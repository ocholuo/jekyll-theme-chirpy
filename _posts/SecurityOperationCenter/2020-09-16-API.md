## SOAP vs REST

The term web API generally refers to both sides of computer systems communicating over a network: 
  - the `API services` offered by a server
  - and the `API` offered by the client such as a web browser.

The server-side portion of the web API is a `programmatic interface to a defined request-response message system`. There are several design models for web services, the two most dominant are SOAP and REST.

SOAP provides the following advantages when compared to REST:
- Language, platform, and transport independent (REST requires use of HTTP)     
- Works well in distributed enterprise environments (REST assumes direct point-to-point communication)
- Standardized
- Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards
- Built-in error handling
- Automation when used with certain language products

REST
- easier to use for the most part and is more flexible
- Uses easy to understand standards like swagger and OpenAPI Specification 3.0
- Smaller learning curve
- Efficient (SOAP uses XML for all messages, REST mostly uses smaller message formats like JSON)
- Fast (no extensive processing required)
- Closer to other Web technologies in design philosophy

As one REST API tutorial put it: SOAP is like an envelope while REST is just a postcard.


### SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
- SOAP relies heavily on XML, and together with schemas, defines a very strongly typed messaging framework.
- Every operation the service provides is explicitly defined, along with the XML structure of the request and response for that operation.
- Each input parameter is similarly defined and bound to a type: for example an integer, a string, or some other complex object.
- All of this is codified in the WSDL â€“ Web Service Description (or Definition, in later versions) Language. The WSDL is often explained as a contract between the provider and the consumer of the service. In programming terms the WSDL can be thought of as a method signature for the web service.
