# NetworkSec - Layer 3 - Router

**each port 1 collision domain, 1 broadcast/port **

---

## Router

- `makes decisions based on logical network address` (like IP address) 
  - has the capability to consider high-layer traffic parameters (like quality of service [QoS] settings) in making its forwarding decisions. 

A router :
- **connects multiple network segments together into a single network**.
  - routes traffic between the segments. 
    - Example
    - the Internet is effectively a single network hosting billions of computers. 
    - Routers route the traffic from segment to segment.
- **routers don’t pass broadcasts**
  - Moving computers to a different segment separated by a router:
  - `effectively reduce traffic` on single segment. 
  - `significantly improve overall performance`
    - Segments separated by routers are `one broadcast domains`. 
    - network with too many computers on a single segment, 
    - broadcasts can result in `excessive collisions` and `reduce network performance`. 
- Similarly, subnetting networks creates separate broadcast domains.

## router and switch. 

difference between router and switch. 


| device | switch                                                          | router                                                                                      |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .      | simple                                                          | sophisticated                                                                               |
| .      | forward packets in a single network                             | forward packets to multiple networks                                                        |
| .      | uses **learned associations** to reduce the use of broadcasting | uses **routing tables** to determine how to forward packets, avoiding broadcast altogether. |


why router rather than multilayer switch? 
- more `feature-rich`
- support a `broader range of interface types`. 
  - example
    - to connect a Layer 3 device out to Internet service provider (ISP) using a serial port
    - more likely to find a serial port expansion module for router, rather than multilayer switch.

## Cisco routers

Connections of router:
- `Straight through`:
  - Switch-router, switch-PC, router-server, hub-PC. Hub-router
- `Cross-over`:
  - switch-hub
  - Switch-switch, PC-PC, hub-hub, router-router

Cisco routers are popular, but many other brands exist. 
- physical devices, most efficient. 
- However, it’s also possible to add routing software to computers with more than one NIC. 
- Example: Windows Server products can function as routers by adding additional services to the server.

## Antispoofing

> From (New S+ ch3)


Spoofing: 
- to impersonate or masquerade as someone or something else. 
- For routers: 
  - attacker `spoof the source IP address`
  - replacing it with a different one.
  - to hide the actual source of the packet. 

antispoofing on router:
- `modifying the access list to allow / block IP addresses`. 

> Example:
> private IP addresses should only be used in private networks. 
> Any traffic coming from the Internet using a private IP address as the source IP address is obviously an attempt to spoof the source IP address. 

The following three rules would be implemented on a router:
- `deny ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 any`
- `deny ip 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255 any`
- `deny ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 any`
- 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 covers all the IP addresses in the range of 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255.
