# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)


![autonomous-system](https://i.imgur.com/kbCel17.png)

The goal of Inter-domain routing
- to find loop free path to the intended destination.
- concerned with reachability than optimality

Finding path anywhere close to optimal is considered to be a great achievement
- **Scalability**
  - An Internet backbone router must be able to forward any packet destined anywhere in the Internet
  - Having a routing table that will provide a match for any valid IP address
- **Autonomous nature of the domains**
  - It is impossible to calculate meaningful path costs for a path that crosses multiple ASs
  - A cost of 1000 across one provider might imply a great path
  - but it might mean an unacceptable bad one from another provider
- **Issues of trust**
  - Provider A might be unwilling to believe certain advertisements from provider B

Each AS has:
- One **BGP speaker** that advertises:
  - local networks
  - other reachable networks (transit AS only)
  - gives path information
- In addition to the BGP speakers, the AS has one or more border “gateways” which need not be the same as the speakers
- **The border gateways**:
  - routers through which packets enter and leave the AS

BGP does not belong to either of the two main classes of routing protocols (distance vectors and link-state protocols)
- BGP advertises complete paths as an `enumerated lists of ASs` to reach a particular network

## BGP Example

![Pasted Graphic 56](https://i.imgur.com/rqFX7KN.png)

- Speaker for AS 2 advertises reachability to P and Q
- `Network 128.96, 192.4.153, 192.4.32, 192.4.3`, can be reached directly from AS 2.
- Speaker for backbone network then advertises
- `Networks 128.96, 192.4.153, 192.4.32, 192.4.3` can be reached along the path <AS 1, AS 2>.
- Speaker can also cancel previously advertised paths


BGP Issues

- the AS numbers carried in BGP need to be unique
  - Example,
  - AS 2 can only recognize itself in the AS path if no other AS identifies itself in the same way
  - AS numbers are 16-bit numbers assigned by a central authority
  - AS is the B segment level


## Integrating Interdomain and Intradomain Routing
￼
- All routers run iBGP and an intradomain routing protocol.
- Border routers (A, D, E) also run eBGP to other ASs
