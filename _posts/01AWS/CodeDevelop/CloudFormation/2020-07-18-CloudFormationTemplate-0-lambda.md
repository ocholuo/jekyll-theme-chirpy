## AWS::Lambda::Function

<font color=red> AWS::Lambda::Function </font>

- To create a function, you need a deployment package and an execution role. 
- The **deployment package** is a `.zip file archive` or `container image` that contains your function code. 
- The **execution role** grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing.

- package type
  - Image 
    - if the deployment package is a container image. 
    - the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry. 
    - <font color=blue> do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties </font>
  - Zip 
    - if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. 
    - the code property specifies the location of the .zip file. 
    - <font color=blue> must specify the handler and runtime properties </font>
      - You can use **code signing** if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. 
      - To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. 
      - When a user attempts to deploy a code package with `UpdateFunctionCode`, Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. 
      - The code-signing configuration includes set set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.
