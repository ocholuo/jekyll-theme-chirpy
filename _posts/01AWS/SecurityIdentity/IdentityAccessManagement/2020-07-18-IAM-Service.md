# AWS services that work with IAM 

The AWS services listed below are grouped by their AWS product categories and include information about what IAM features they support:

- **Service**
  - choose the name of a service to view the AWS documentation about IAM authorization and access for that service. 

- **Actions**
  - can specify individual actions in a policy. 
  - If the service does not support this feature, then **All actions** is selected in the visual editor
  - In a JSON policy document, you must use `*` in the `Action` element. 
     
- **Resource-level permissions**
  - can use ARNs to specify individual resources in the policy. 
  - If the service does not support this feature, then **All resources** is chosen in the policy visual editor
  - In a JSON policy document, you must use `*` in the `Resource` element. 
  - Some actions, such as `List*` actions, do not support specifying an ARN because they are designed to return multiple resources. 
  - If a service supports this feature for some resources but not others, it is indicated by yellow cells in the table. See the documentation for that service for more information.

- **Resource-based policies**
  - can attach resource-based policies to a resource within the service. 
  - Resource-based policies include a `Principal` element to specify which IAM identities can access that resource.

- **Authorization based on tags**
  - can use [resource tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html) in the condition of a policy to control access to a resource in the service. 
  - You do this using the `aws:ResourceTag` global condition key or service-specific tags, such as `ec2:ResourceTag`

- **Temporary credentials**
  - can use short-term credentials that you obtain when you sign in using SSO, switch roles in the console, or that you generate using AWS STS in the AWS CLI or AWS API. 
  - You can access services with a **No** value only while using your long-term IAM user credentials. 
  - This includes a user name and password or your user access keys.  

- **Service-linked roles** 
  - A service-linked role is a special type of service role that gives the service permission to access resources in other services on your behalf. 
  - Choose the `Yes` link to see the documentation for services that support these roles. 
  - This column does not indicate if the service uses standard service roles.  

- **More information**
  - If a service doesn't fully support a feature, you can review the footnotes for an entry to view the limitations and links to related information.

Any `Action` element that includes the `ec2:*VpcEndpoint*` or `ec2:DescribePrefixLists` API actions must specify "`"Resource": "*"`". For more information, see [Controlling the Use of Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html#vpc-endpoints-iam-access) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

² Amazon VPC supports attaching a single resource policy to a VPC endpoint to restrict what can be accessed through that endpoint. For more information about using resource-based policies to control access to resources from specific Amazon VPC endpoints, see [Using Endpoint Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html#vpc-endpoint-policies) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.
