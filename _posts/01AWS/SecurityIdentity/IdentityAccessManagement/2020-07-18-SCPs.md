# Service Control Policies (SCPs) 

--- 

## basic

- one type of policy

- use <font color=red> to manage organization </font>
  - Attaching an SCP to an AWS Organizations entity (root, OU, or account) 
  - defines a guardrail for what actions the principals can perform.

- enables <font color=red> permission controls </font>
  - can <font color=blue> limit account usage </font> to organizational units or linked accounts.
  - offer <font color=red> central control </font> over the maximum available permissions <font color=blue> for all accounts in organization </font>
  - ensure accounts stay in organization’s access control guidelines.

- available only in an organization that <font color=red> has all features enabled </font>
  - SCPs are not automatically enabled;
  - including consolidated billing
    - SCPs aren't available if organization has enabled only the consolidated billing feature

- <font color=red> restrict the root user of an Organization Unit account </font> 
  - SCP is a way to restrict a root user on an account.
  - defines a safeguard for the actions that accounts in the organization root or OU can do.
  - Attaching an SCP to the organization root/unit (OU)
    - Log in to the master account and create the SCP
    - Select the <font color=blue> Organizational Unit </font>
    - <font color=blue> Enable the SCP </font> for the Organizational Unit
    - Attach the SCP to the member account within the Organizational Unit

- <font color=red> not a substitute for well-managed each account </font>
  - still need attach IAM policies to users/roles in organization's accounts 
  - to actually grant permissions to them.

- similar to IAM permissions policies
  - almost the same syntax. JSON
  - but, SCP policies <font color=blue> never grants permissions. </font> 
    - <font color=red> it the maximum permissions </font> for an organization or OU.

- <font color=red> No permissions are granted by an SCP </font>
  - it defines a guardrail, or sets limits, on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users/roles in the affected accounts. 
    - The administrator must still attach `identity/resource-based policies` to IAM users/roles, or to the resources in accounts to actually grant permissions. 
  - The <font color=blue> effective permissions </font>
    - the logical intersection between **what is allowed by the SCP** and **what is allowed by the IAM/Resource-based policies**
  - Important
    - SCPs don't affect users or roles in the management account. 
    - affect only the member accounts in the organization.

- by default `FullAWSAccess`
  - a service control policy
  - allows users to access services/resources on an attached account.
  - allows access to all AWS services within an attached member account

## Testing effects of SCPs

> recommends
> don't attach SCPs to the root of the organization without thoroughly testing the impact that the policy has on accounts. 

Instead, create an OU that you can move the accounts into one at a time, or at least in small numbers, to ensure that you don't inadvertently lock users out of key services. 


to determine whether a service is used by an account
1. examine the [service last accessed data in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/accesspoliciesaccess-advisor.html). 
2. [use AWS CloudTrail to log service usage at the API level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/how-cloudtrail-works.html).

## Maximum size of SCPs

All characters in the SCP count against its maximum size.  
- if the policy size approaches the maximum size, delete any white space, such as space characters and line breaks that are outside quotation marks.

> Use the visual editor to build the SCP. 
> It automatically removes extra white space.

## Effects on permissions

- similar to AWS IAM permission policies and use almost the same syntax. 
- However, an SCP never grants permissions. 
- Instead, SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for the affected accounts. 

- <font color=red> SCPs affect only IAM users/roles managed by accounts that are part of the organization </font>
  - don't affect resource-based policies directly. 
  - also don't affect users or roles from accounts outside the organization. 
  - For example
  - an Amazon S3 bucket that's owned by account A in an organization. 
  - The bucket policy (resource-based policy) grants access to users from account B outside the organization. 
  - Account A has an SCP attached that doesn't apply to those outside users in account B. 
  - The SCP applies only to users that are managed by account A in the organization.

- <font color=red> SCP restricts permissions for IAM users/roles in member accounts, including the member account's root user </font>
  - Any account has only those permissions permitted by **every** parent above it. 
  - If a permission is blocked at any level above the account
    - either implicitly
      - not being included in an <font color=red> Allow </font> policy statement
    - or explicitly
      - being included in a <font color=red> Deny </font> policy statement
  - a user/role in the affected account can't use that permission
  - even if the account administrator attaches the <font color=red> AdministratorAccess </font> IAM policy with `*/*` permissions to the user.
    
- <font color=red> SCPs affect only member accounts in the organization </font>
  - They have no effect on users or roles in the management account.
    
- Users/roles must still be <font color=red> granted permissions by IAM permission policies  </font>
  - A user without any IAM permission policies has no access, even if the applicable SCPs allow all services and all actions.
    
  - If a user/role has an <font color=blue> IAM permission policy grants access to an action that is also allowed by the applicable SCPs </font>
    - the user/role can perform that action.
      
  - If a user/role has an <font color=blue> IAM permission policy grants access to an action that is not allowed or explicitly denied by the applicable SCPs </font>
    - the user/role can't perform that action.
      
- <font color=red> SCPs affect all users/roles in attached accounts, including the root user </font> 
  - The only exceptions are 
  - some <font color=blue> Tasks and entities not restricted by SCPs </font>
    - Any action performed by the management account
    - Any action performed using permissions that are attached to a service-linked role
    - Register for the Enterprise support plan as the root user
    - Change the AWS support level as the root user
    - Manage Amazon CloudFront keys as the root user
    - Provide trusted signer functionality for CloudFront private content
    - Configure reverse DNS for an Amazon Lightsail email server as the root user
    - Tasks on some AWS-related services:
      - Alexa Top Sites
      - Alexa Web Information Service
      - Amazon Mechanical Turk 
      - Amazon Product Marketing API 

  - **Exceptions for only member accounts created before September 15, 2017**
    - **can't** use SCPs to prevent the root user in those member accounts from performing the following tasks:
    - Enable or disable multi-factor authentication on the root user 
    - Create, update, or delete x.509 keys for the root user 
    - Change the root user's password 
    - Create, update, or delete root access keys
  - For **all** accounts created after September 15, 2017, the exceptions don't apply and you **can-* use SCPs to prevent the root user in those member accounts from performing the following tasks. 
  - However, unless you are certain that **all** of the accounts in the organization were created after September 15, 2017, recommend that don’t rely on SCPs to try to restrict these operations



- <font color=red> SCPs do not affect any service-linked role </font>
  - Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations 
  - can't be restricted by SCPs.
    
- <font color=red> disable the SCP policy type in a root </font>
  - all SCPs are automatically detached from all AWS Organizations entities in that root 
    - AWS Organizations entities: organizational units, organizations, and accounts. 

- <font color=red> reenable SCPs in a root </font>
  - that root reverts to only the default `FullAWSAccess` policy automatically attached to all entities in the root. 
  - Any attachments of SCPs to AWS Organizations entities from before SCPs were disabled are lost and aren't automatically recoverable, although you can manually reattach them.
    
- <font color=red> If both a permissions boundary (an advanced IAM feature) and an SCP are present </font> 
  - then the boundary, the SCP, and the identity-based policy must all allow the action.


---

## Using access data to improve SCPs

When signed in with management account credentials 
- IAM console > AWS Organizations section, view **service last accessed data** for an AWS Organizations entity or policy
- or use the AWS CLI or AWS API in IAM to retrieve **service last accessed data**. 

service last accessed data
- includes information about which allowed services that the IAM users/roles in an AWS Organizations account last attempted to access and when. 
- use this information to identify unused permissions so that you can refine the SCPs to better adhere to the principle of least privilege 

example
- might have a deny list SCP that prohibits access to three AWS services. 
- All services that aren't listed in the SCP's <font color=red> Deny </font> statement are allowed. 
- The **service last accessed data** in IAM tells you which AWS services are allowed by the SCP but are never used. 
- update the SCP to deny access to services that don't need.

example:

- [Viewing Organizations Service Last Accessed Data for Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/accesspoliciesaccess-advisor-view-data-orgs.html)
    
- [Using Data to Refine Permissions for an Organizational Unit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/accesspoliciesaccess-advisor-example-scenarios.html#accesspoliciesaccess-advisor-reduce-permissions-orgs)
    

---

 
## create, update, and delete

When you sign in to the organization's management account, you can create and update [service control policies (SCPs)](./orgs_manage_policies_scps.html). 
- building statements that deny or allow access to services and actions 


The default configuration for working with SCPs is to use a "block list" strategy 
- where all actions are implicitly allowed except for those actions you want to block by creating statements that deny access. 
- With deny statements, you can specify resources and conditions for the statement and use the [NotAction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_notaction.html) element.  

> use [service last accessed data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html) in IAM as a data point for updating the SCPs to restrict access to only the AWS services that you need.  

---

### Creating an SCP 

- Minimum permissions
  - To create SCPs, need permission to run the following action:
  - `organizations:CreatePolicy`
     
- AWS CLI
  - [aws organizations create-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/create-policy.html)
  - Example 
  - assumes have a file named `Deny-IAM.json` with the JSON policy text in it. 
  - It uses that file to create a new service control policy.
    
```bash
$ aws organizations create-policy \
  --content file://Deny-IAM.json \
  --description "Deny all IAM actions" \
  --name DenyIAMSCP \
  --type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY 
# {
#   "Policy": {
#       "PolicySummary": {
#           "Id": "p-i9j8k7l6m5",
#           "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:policy/o-aa111bb222/service_control_policy/p-i9j8k7l6m5",
#           "Name": "DenyIAMSCP",
#           "Description": "Deny all IAM actions",
#           "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY",
#           "AwsManaged": false
#       },
#       "Content": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"Statement1\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Action\":[\"iam:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}"
#   }
# }
```

  - [CreatePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicy.html)
    

---

### Updating an SCP 


Minimum permissions
- To update an SCP, you need permission to run the following actions:

  - `organizations:UpdatePolicy` 
    - with a `Resource` element in the same policy statement that includes the ARN of the specified policy (or `\*`)
      
  - `organizations:DescribePolicy` 
    - with a `Resource` element in the same policy statement that includes the ARN of the specified policy (or `\*`)


- AWS CLI: 
  - [aws organizations update-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/update-policy.html)
  - Example  

```bash 
# renames a policy. 
$ aws organizations update-policy \
  --policy-id p-i9j8k7l6m5 \
  --name "MyRenamedPolicy"
# {
#   "Policy": {
#       "PolicySummary": {
#           "Id": "p-i9j8k7l6m5",
#           "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:policy/o-aa111bb222/service_control_policy/p-i9j8k7l6m5",
#           "Name": "MyRenamedPolicy",
#           "Description": "Blocks all IAM actions",
#           "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY",
#           "AwsManaged": false
#       },
#       "Content": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"Statement1\",\"Effect\":\"Den\"Action\":[\"iam:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}"
#   }
# }


# adds or changes the description for a service control policy.
$ aws organizations update-policy \
  --policy-id p-i9j8k7l6m5 \
  --description "My new policy description"
  # {
  #       "Policy": {
  #           "PolicySummary": {
  #               "Id": "p-i9j8k7l6m5",
  #               "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:policy/o-aa111bb222/service_control_policy/p-i9j8k7l6m5",

  #       }
  # }
  

# changes the policy document of the SCP by specifying a file that contains the new JSON policy text.
$ aws organizations update-policy \
  --policy-id p-zlfw1r64 
  --content file://MyNewPolicyText.json
  # {
  #       "Policy": {
  #           "PolicySummary": {

### Editing tags attached to an SCP 

add or remove the tags attached to an SCP. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging AWS Organizations resources](./orgs_tagging.html).

- Minimum permissions
  - To edit the tags attached to an SCP in the AWS organization, you must have the following permissions: 
    - `organizations:DescribeOrganization` – required only when using the Organizations console 
    - `organizations:DescribePolicy` – required only when using the Organizations console 
    - `organizations:TagResource` 
    - `organizations:UntagResource`
        
- AWS CLI: 
  - [aws organizations tag-resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/tag-resource.html) 
  - [aws organizations untag-resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/untag-resource.html)
    
- AWS SDKs: 
  - [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) 
  - [UntagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html)
    

---


### Deleting an SCP 


- Before you can delete a policy, you must first detach it from all attached entities.
- can't delete any AWS managed SCP such as the SCP named `FullAWSAccess`.
    
- Minimum permissions
  - To delete an SCP, you need permission to run the following action:
  - `organizations:DeletePolicy`
    
 
- AWS CLI: 
  - [aws organizations delete-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/delete-policy.html)

```bash
$ aws organizations delete-policy \
  --policy-id p-i9j8k7l6m5
  # This command produces no output when successful.
```
    
- AWS SDKs: 
  - [DeletePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePolicy.html)


---


## Attach and detach 

---

### Attach 

Minimum permissions
- To attach an SCP to a root, OU, or account, you need permission to run the following action:
- `organizations:AttachPolicy` 
  - with a `Resource` element in the same policy statement that 
    - includes 
    - `*` or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specified policy 
    - and the ARN of the root, OU, or account that you want to attach the policy to

- AWS CLI:

```bash
$ aws organizations attach-policy \
    --policy-id p-i9j8k7l6m5 \
    --target-id ou-a1b2-f6g7h222
This command produces no output when successful.
```
- AWS SDKs: `AttachPolicy`

---

### Detaching an SCP from the organization root, OUs, or accounts

> You can't detach the last SCP from a root, an OU, or an account. There must be at least one SCP attached to every root, OU, and account at all times.

Minimum permissions
- To detach an SCP from the root, OU, or account, you need permission to run the following action:
- `organizations:DetachPolicy`


- AWS CLI:

```bash
$ aws organizations detach-policy \
    --policy-id p-i9j8k7l6m5 \
    --target-id ou-a1b2-f6g7h222
```

- AWS SDKs: `DetachPolicy`


---


## Strategies for using SCPs

configure the service control policies (SCPs) as either of the following:
 
- A deny list strategy
  - actions are allowed by default, 
  - and you specify what services and actions are prohibited
  - makes use of the `FullAWSAccess` SCP attached by default to every OU and account. 
  - This SCP 
    - overrides the default implicit deny
    - explicitly allows all permissions from the root to every account
    - unless explicitly deny a permission with an additional SCP created and attached to the appropriate OU or account. 
  - This strategy works because an <font color=red> explicit deny in a policy always overrides allow </font>
  - No account below the level of the OU with the deny policy can use the denied API
  - and there is no way to add the permission back lower in the hierarchy. 
 
- An allow list strategy
  - actions are prohibited by default
  - and you specify what services and actions are allowed
  - remove the `FullAWSAccess` SCP ttached by default to every OU and account. 
  - no APIs are permitted anywhere unless you explicitly allow them. 
  - To allow a service API to operate in an AWS account, you must create your own SCPs and attach them to the account and every OU above it, up to and including the root. 
  - Every SCP in the hierarchy, starting at the root, must explicitly allow the APIs to be usable in the OUs and accounts below it. 
  - This strategy works because an <font color=red> explicit allow in an SCP overrides an implicit 暗示的 deny </font> 


---

### SCPs `FullAWSAccess`

AWS Organizations attaches an AWS managed SCP named `FullAWSAccess` to every root and OU when it's created. 
- This policy allows all services and actions. 
- attach or detach from the entities in your organization as needed. 
- Because the policy is an AWS managed SCP, you can't modify or delete it. 

The policy looks like the following.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

---


### Using SCPs as a deny list

The default configuration of AWS Organizations supports using SCPs as deny lists. 
- Using a deny list strategy
- account administrators can delegate all services and actions until you create and attach an SCP that denies a specific service or set of actions. 
- Deny statements require less maintenance, 
  - no need to update them when AWS adds new services. 
- Deny statements usually use less space
  - easier to stay within the maximum size for SCPs. 
- In a statement where the Effect element has a value of Deny, you can also restrict access to specific resources, or define conditions for when SCPs are in effect.


Such a policy might look like the following example

```json

// 1.
// This SCP still allows all other services and their actions.
// prevents users in the affected accounts from performing any actions for the Amazon DynamoDB service.   
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowsAllActions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DenyDynamoDB", 
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "dynamodb:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}


// 2. leaving the FullAWSAccess policy in place 
// and then attaching a second policy that has only the Deny statement in it 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "dynamodb:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```


---


### Using SCPs as an allow list

1. must replace the AWS managed `FullAWSAccess` SCP with an SCP that explicitly permits only those services and actions that you want to allow. 
2. By removing the default `FullAWSAccess` SCP, all actions for all services are now implicitly denied. 
3. Your custom SCP then overrides the implicit Deny with an explicit Allow for only those actions that you want to permit. 
4. For a permission to be enabled for a specified account, every SCP from the root through each OU in the direct path to the account, and even attached to the account itself, must allow that permission.
 
An Allow statement in an SCP 
- can't have a Resource element with anything except a "*".
- can't have a Condition element at all.


An allow list policy might look like the following example

```json
// enables account users to perform operations for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon CloudWatch, but no other service.
//  All SCPs in parent OUs and the root also must explicitly allow these permissions.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:*",
                "cloudwatch:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
