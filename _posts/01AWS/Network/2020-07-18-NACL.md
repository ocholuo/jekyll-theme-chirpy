The VPC router hosts the network ACL function.
- controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
- might set up NACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.



- Stateless
  - "Stateless rules" inspect all inbound and outbound traffic,
  - no information about a request is maintained after a request is processed.
  - don’t keep track of connections, sessions,
  - allow traffic based on an incoming rule
    - responses are subject to the rules for the direction of traffic.
  - don’t automatically allow the corresponding outgoing traffic.

  - NACLs only apply to traffic ingress or egress to the subnet
    - not traffic within the subnet.
    - do not filter traffic between instances in the same subnet.


- provide a firewall/security/optional layer of security for VPC <font colore=red> at the subnet level </font>
  - acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in / out of one or more subnets.
  - set up network ACLs with rules that are similar to your security groups.

- All subnets must be associated with a network ACL.
  - no create NACL for a subnet, a “default NACL” will be assigned.  
    - the subnet is automatically associated with the default NACL.
    - recommended evaluate security requirements and define each network ACL accordingly.
  - can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets;
  - but a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time.
    - When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.

- default network ACL: (All allow)
  - allows all inbound and outbound IPv4/IPv6 traffic
    - default all inbound and outbound traffic is automatically blocked.
    - but default NACL have an allow rule must be explicitly created.
    - (pre-created by default VPC) ALLOW ALL inbound/outbound traffic
- custom NACL: (all deny)
  - denies all traffic both inbound and outbound by default.
  - denies all until you add rules.


- A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, can either allow or deny traffic.
  - NACLs preferred blocking specific IPs or ranges.
    - Security groups cannot be used to block specific ranges of IPs.
    - NACL is the first line of defence,
    - the security group is the second line.
  - rules defined by source, destination, port, and protocol.

- A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules in order,
  - starting with the lowest numbered rule.
  - from the lowest number until the explicit deny.
  - The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32,766.
  - Rules are evaluated in numerical order.
    - Recommended to leave spacing between network ACL numbers.
  - associate up to 200 network ACLs in each VPC.



- Changes to NACLs take effect immediately.



- Also recommended to have software firewalls installed on your instances.
