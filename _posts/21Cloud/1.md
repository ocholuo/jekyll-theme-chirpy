## IaaS infrastructure as a service

- share compute resources with others by virtualizing the hardware.
- Each Virtual Machine has its own instance of an operating system
- and you build and run applications on it with access to <font color=blue> memory, file systems, networking interfaces, and the other attributes </font> that physical computers also have.

- <font color=red> But flexibility comes with a cost </font>
  - the smallest unit of compute is a <font color=red> Virtual Machine together with its application </font>
  - The guest operating system maybe large, even gigabytes
  - It can take minutes to boot up.
  - Virtual Machine
    - highly configurable
    - can install and run the tools of choice.
    - can configure the underlying system resources
      - such as disks and networking,
    - can install the own web server database or a middle ware.

  - But the application demand increases,
    - have to scale out in units of an entire Virtual Machine with a guest operating system for each.
    - the resource consumption grows faster

## PaaS Platform as a Service

- like App Engine
  - Instead of getting a blank Virtual Machine, get access to a family of services that applications need.
  - write the code and self-contained workloads that use these services and include any dependent libraries.
- As demand for the application increases
  - the platform scales the applications seamlessly and independently by workload and infrastructure.
  - scales rapidly
  - but you give up control of the underlying server architecture.
