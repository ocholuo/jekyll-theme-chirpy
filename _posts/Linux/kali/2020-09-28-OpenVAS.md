# OpenVAS on Kali Linux

[toc]

## Setup Kali for installing OpenVAS

1. make sure Kali is up-to-date and install the latest OpenVAS.
2. run the `openvas-setup` command to setup OpenVAS, download the latest rules, create an admin user, and start up the various services.

```bash
root@kali:~# sudo apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade -y
root@kali:~# sudo reboot
root@kali:~# sudo apt-get install openvas -y

sudo gvm-setup

root@kali:~# sudo openvas-setup
[>] Checking redis.conf
[*] Editing redis.conf
[>] Checking openvassd.conf
[*] Adding to openvassd.conf
[>] Restarting redis-server
[>] Checking OpenVAS certificate infrastructure
[*] Creating OpenVAS certificate infrastructure
[>] Updating OpenVAS feeds
[*] Opening Web UI (https://127.0.0.1:9392) in: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
[>] Checking for admin user
[*] Creating admin user
User created with password 'e432aa97-2fd3-4c1b-8c16-1166cbd19d70'.
[+] Done


# !!!!
# When it’s done, it will show the admin login username and admin login password
sudo gvm-start
[*] Please note the password for the admin user
[*] User created with password 'd201fc56-6201-4f73-a646-c4787b1435fd'.


# Update feed for OpenVAS (Only required if there is new updates), when initializing, this step was done once already.
sudo gvm-feed-update


# Launch OpenVAS
sudo openvas-start
```

### Setup Errors

1. Occasionally, the ‘openvas-setup’ script will display errors at the end of the NVT download similar to the following.

```bash
(openvassd:2272): lib kb_redis-CRITICAL **: get_redis_ctx: redis connection error: No such file or directory
(openvassd:2272): lib kb_redis-CRITICAL **: redis_new: cannot access redis at '/var/run/redis/redis.sock'
(openvassd:2272): lib kb_redis-CRITICAL **: get_redis_ctx: redis connection error: No such file or directory
openvassd: no process found

# detects the issue and even provides the command to run to (hopefully) resolve the issue.
# see what component is causing issues.
openvas-check-setup
```


2. ` bash: …..: command not found error`

The Fix

```bash
# OpenVAS is changing the name, the new command gvm will replace all openvas commands.
# Since Kali Rolling updated repository, use gvm instead of openvas commands
sudo apt install gvm -y
sudo gvm-setup
sudo gvm-feed-update
sudo gvm-start


```

## Checking for OpenVAS ports
Once `openvas-setup` completes its process, the OpenVAS manager, scanner, and GSAD services should be listening:

```bash
root@kali:~# root@kali:~# netstat -antp
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:9392          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4774/gsad

# 9392 is for WebGUI/OpenVAS Web Interface.
# TCP ports 9390 and 9392 listening on your loopback interface.

root@kali:~# ss -ant

LISTEN 0 128 127.0.0.1:9390 *:*
LISTEN 0 128 127.0.0.1:9392 *:*
```

## Checking OpenVAS services
run `openvas-check-setup` before launching OpenVAS just in case something went missing.

```bash

root@kali:~# openvas-check-setup
openvas-check-setup 2.3.7
  Test completeness and readiness of OpenVAS-9
  ...
 ERROR: Your OpenVAS-9 installation is not yet complete!

Please follow the instructions marked with FIX above and run this
script again.

If you think this result is wrong, please report your observation
and help us to improve this check routine:
http://lists.wald.intevation.org/mailman/listinfo/openvas-discuss
Please attach the log-file (/tmp/openvas-check-setup.log) to help us analyze the problem.
# The fix is given as well, run greenbone-scapdata-sync and it will sync OpenVAS SCAP database files.

### Setup OpenVAS User account and changing password

```bash
# set manual password and create a new user from CLI.
root@kali:~# openvasmd --create-user=luo
User created with password '19c29356-c59e-481a-8c3d-80225f80302b'.
root@kali:~# openvasmd --create-user=blackmoreops
User created with password 'b4f70c8b-1c45-442d-a41b-b87b24f473b6'.

# new passwd
root@kali:~# openvasmd --user=blackmoreops --new-password=operations1
root@kali:~# openvasmd --user=admin --new-password=administrator1
root@kali:~# openvasmd --user=usrnamw --new-password=operations1

root@kali:~# openvasmd --get-users
admin
usrname
blackmoreops
```

---


## Start and end OpenVAS services

```bash
root@kali:~# openvas-start
[*] Please wait for the OpenVAS services to start.
[*] Web UI (Greenbone Security Assistant): https://127.0.0.1:9392

● greenbone-security-assistant.service - Greenbone Security Assistant

## Connect to the OpenVAS Web Interface Greenbone Security Assistant

1. https://127.0.0.1:9392
2. accept the self signed SSL certificate `confirm security exception`
3. Type in Admin username and password or one of the new users you’ve setup and bang

## Configure OpenVAS

---

### Configuring Credentials
Vulnerability scanners provide the most complete results when you are able to provide the scanning engine with credentials to use on scanned systems. OpenVAS will use these credentials to log in to the scanned system and perform detailed enumeration of installed software, patches, etc.
- add credentials via the “Credentials” entry under the “Configuration” menu.

---

### Target Configuration
OpenVAS, like most vulnerability scanners, can scan for remote systems
- but it’s a vulnerability scanner, not a port scanner.
- Rather than relying on a vulnerability scanner for identifying hosts,  much easier by using a dedicated network scanner like `Nmap` or `Masscan` and import the list of targets in `OpenVAS`.

```bash
# 1. identifying hosts
root@kali:~# nmap -sn -oA nmap-subnet-86 192.168.86.0/24
root@kali:~# grep Up nmap-subnet-86.gnmap | cut -d " " -f 2 > live-hosts.txt

# 2. import list of hosts
# import them under the “Targets” section of the “Configuration” menu.
```

---

### Scan Configuration
Prior to launching a vulnerability scan, you should fine-tune the Scan Config that will be used
- “Configuration” > "Scan Configs"
- can clone any of the default Scan Configs and edit its options, disabling any services or checks that don’t require.
- use Nmap to conduct some prior analysis of your target(s) to save hours of vulnerability scanning time.

---

### Task Configuration
credentials, targets, and scan configurations -> run a vulnerability scan.
- In OpenVAS, vulnerability scans are conducted as “Tasks”.
- When set up a new task, can further optimize the scan by either increasing or decreasing the concurrent activities that take place.
- With system with 3GB of RAM, we adjusted our task settings as shown below.

With our more finely-tuned scan settings and target selection, the results of our scan are much more useful.

## Automating OpenVAS

`openvas-automate.sh` by mgeeky
- a semi-interactive Bash script 
- prompts you for a scan type and takes care of the rest. 
- The scan configs are hard-coded in the script so if you want to use your customized configs, added under the “targets” section.

```bash
root@kali:~# apt -y install pcregrep
root@kali:~# ./openvas-automate.sh 192.168.86.61:: OpenVAS automation script.
mgeeky, 0.1[>] Please select scan type:
1. Discovery
2. Full and fast
3. Full and fast ultimate
4. Full and very deep
5. Full and very deep ultimate
6. Host Discovery
7. System Discovery
8. Exit

--------------------------------
