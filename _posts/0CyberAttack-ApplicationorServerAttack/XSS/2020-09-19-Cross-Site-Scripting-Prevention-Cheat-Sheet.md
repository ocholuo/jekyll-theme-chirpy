# Cross Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet

[toc]

## Introduction

- Both [reflected and stored XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#stored-and-reflected-xss-attacks) can be addressed by performing the appropriate validation and encoding on the server-side.
- [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS) can be addressed with a special subset of rules described in the [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md).

### Why Can't Just `HTML Entity Encode` Untrusted Data

`HTML entity encoding`
- okay for untrusted data that you put in the body of the HTML document, such as inside a `<div>` tag.
- or for untrusted data that goes into attributes, particularly if you're religious about using quotes around your attributes.

But HTML entity encoding doesn't work if you're putting untrusted data inside a `<script>` tag anywhere, or an `event handler attribute` like `onmouseover`, or inside CSS, or in a URL.
- So even if you use an `HTML entity encoding` method everywhere, you are still most likely vulnerable to XSS.
- **You MUST use the encode syntax for the part of the HTML document you're putting untrusted data into.** That's what the rules below are all about.

### You Need a Security Encoding Library

Writing these encoders is not tremendously difficult, but there are quite a few hidden pitfalls.
- For example, you might be tempted to use some of the escaping shortcuts like `\"` in JavaScript.
- However, these values are dangerous and may be misinterpreted by the nested parsers in the browser. You might also forget to escape the escape character, which attackers can use to neutralize your attempts to be safe.
- OWASP recommends using a security-focused encoding library to make sure these rules are properly implemented.

Microsoft provides an encoding library named the [Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=wpl) for the .NET platform and ASP.NET Framework has built-in [ValidateRequest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972969.aspx#securitybarriers_topic6) function that provides **limited** sanitization.

The [OWASP Java Encoder Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-java-encoder/) provides a high-performance encoding library for Java.

## XSS Prevention Rules
- to prevent all XSS in application.
- While these rules do not allow absolute freedom in putting untrusted data into an HTML document, they should cover the vast majority of common use cases.
- You do not have to allow **all** the rules in your organization. Many organizations may find that **allowing only Rule \#1 and Rule \#2 are sufficient for their needs**.

**Do NOT** simply encode/escape the list of example characters provided in the various rules.
- It is NOT sufficient to encode/escape only that list.
- Blacklist approaches are quite fragile.
- The whitelist rules have been carefully designed to provide protection even against future vulnerabilities introduced by browser changes.

---

### RULE \#0 - Never Insert Untrusted Data Except in Allowed Locations
- The first rule is to **deny all**
- don't put untrusted data into HTML document
    - unless it is within one of the slots defined in Rule \#1 through Rule \#5.
    - there are many strange contexts within HTML that the list of encoding rules gets very complicated.
    - no good reason to put untrusted data in these contexts.
        - This includes "nested contexts" like a URL inside a JavaScript -- the encoding rules for those locations are tricky and dangerous.
- never accept actual JavaScript code from an untrusted source and then run it.
    - For example
    - a parameter named "callback" that contains a JavaScript code snippet.
    - No amount of encoding/escaping can fix that.

Directly in a script:

```html
<script>...NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE...</script>
```

Inside an HTML comment:

```html
<!--...NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE...-->
```

In an attribute name:

```html
<div ...NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE...=test />
```

In a tag name:

```html
<NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE... href="/test" />
```

Directly in CSS:

```c
<style>
NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE
</style>
```

---

### RULE \#1 - `HTML Encode` Before Inserting Untrusted Data into `HTML Element Content`
- when want to put untrusted data directly into the HTML body somewhere.
    - This includes inside normal tags like `div`, `p`, `b`, `td`, etc.
- Most web frameworks have a method for `HTML encoding/escaping` for the characters detailed below.
- However, this is **absolutely not sufficient for other HTML contexts.** You need to implement the other rules detailed here as well.

```html
<body>
...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...
</body>
```

```html
<div>
...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...
</div>
```

- Encode the following characters with `HTML entity encoding` to prevent switching into any execution context
    - such as script, style, or event handlers.
    - Using hex entities is recommended in the spec.

```text
 & --> &amp;
 < --> &lt;
 > --> &gt;
 " --> &quot;
 ' --> &#x27;
 / --> &#x2F;  it helps to end an HTML entity.

 &apos; not recommended because its not in the HTML spec (See: section 24.4.1)
 &apos; is in the XML and XHTML specs.
```

---

### RULE \#2 - `Attribute Encode` Before Inserting Untrusted Data into `HTML Common Attributes`
- for putting untrusted data into typical attribute values like `width`, `name`, `value`, etc.
- This should not be used for
    - complex attributes like `href`, `src`, `style`,
    - or event handlers like `onmouseover`.
- It is extremely important that event handler attributes should follow Rule \#3 for HTML JavaScript Data Values.

Inside **UNquoted** attribute:

```html
<div attr=...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...>content
```

Inside single quoted attribute:

```html
<div attr='...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...'>content
```

Inside double quoted attribute :

```html
<div attr="...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...">content
```

- Except for alphanumeric characters
- encode all characters with `ASCII values` less than 256 with the `&#xHH;` format (or a named entity if available) to prevent switching out of the attribute.
- developers frequently leave attributes unquoted.
- Properly quoted attributes can only be escaped with the corresponding quote.
- Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters, including
    - `[space]` `%` `*` `+` `,` `-` `/` `;` `<` `=` `>` `^` `|`.

---

### RULE \#3 - `JavaScript Encode` Before Inserting Untrusted Data into `JavaScript Data Values`
- dynamically generated JavaScript code - both script blocks and event-handler attributes.
- The only safe place to put untrusted data into this code is inside a quoted "data value."
- Including untrusted data inside any other JavaScript context is quite dangerous, as it is extremely easy to switch into an execution context with characters including (not limited to) `semi-colon ;`, `equals =`, `space`, `plus + `...

Inside a quoted string:

```html
<script>alert('...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...')</script>
```

One side of a quoted expression:

```html
<script>x='...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...'</script>
```

Inside quoted event handler:

```html
<div onmouseover="x='...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...'"</div>
```

> note
> there are some JavaScript functions can never safely use untrusted data as input
> **EVEN IF JAVASCRIPT ENCODED!**
<!-- textlint-enable -->

For example:

```html
<script>
window.setInterval('...EVEN IF YOU ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA YOU ARE XSSED HERE...');
</script>
```

- Except for alphanumeric characters, encode all characters less than 256 with the `\xHH` format to prevent switching out of the data value into the script context or into another attribute.
- **DO NOT** use any escaping shortcuts like `\"`
    - because the quote character may be matched by the HTML attribute parser which runs first.
    - These escaping shortcuts are also susceptible to **escape-the-escape attacks** where the attacker sends `\"` and the vulnerable code turns that into `\\"` which enables the quote.

- If an event handler is properly quoted, breaking out requires the corresponding quote.

- However, we have intentionally made this rule quite broad because event handler attributes are often left unquoted.
- Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters including
    - `[space]` `%` `*` `+` `,` `-` `/` `;` `<` `=` `>` `^` `|`.

- Also, a `</script>` closing tag will close a script block even though it is inside a quoted string
    - because the HTML parser runs before the JavaScript parser.
- Please note this is an aggressive encoding policy that over-encodes.
- If there is a guarantee that proper quoting is accomplished then a much smaller character set is needed.

---

#### RULE \#3.1 - `HTML Encode JSON values` in an HTML context and read the data with `JSON.parse`
- having data dynamically generated by an application in a JavaScript context is common.
- One strategy is to make an `AJAX call` to get the values
    - this isn't always performant.
- Often, an initial block of JSON is loaded into the page to act as a single place to store multiple values.
- This data is tricky to encode/escape correctly without breaking the format and content of the values.

**Ensure returned `Content-Type` header is `application/json` and not `text/html`.**
- This shall instruct the browser not misunderstand the context and execute injected script

**Bad HTTP response:**

```text
HTTP/1.1 200
Date: Wed, 06 Feb 2013 10:28:54 GMT
Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5....
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 <-- bad
....
Content-Length: 373
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
{"Message":"No HTTP resource was found that matches the request URI 'dev.net.ie/api/pay/.html?HouseNumber=9&AddressLine
=The+Gardens<script>alert(1)</script>&AddressLine2=foxlodge+woods&TownName=Meath'." ,
"MessageDetail":"No type was found that matches the controller named 'pay'."}   <-- this script will pop!!
```

**Good HTTP response:**

```text
HTTP/1.1 200
Date: Wed, 06 Feb 2013 10:28:54 GMT
Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5....
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 <--good
.....
```

A common **anti-pattern** one would see:

```html
<script>
// Do NOT do this without encoding the data with one of the techniques listed below.
var initData = <%= data.to_json %>;
</script>
```

##### JSON serialization

A safe JSON serializer will allow developers to serialize JSON as string of literal JavaScript which can be embedded in an HTML in the contents of the `<script>` tag. HTML characters and JavaScript line terminators need be encoded. Consider the [Yahoo JavaScript Serializer](https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript) for this task.

##### HTML entity encoding

This technique has the advantage that HTML entity encoding is widely supported and helps separate data from server side code without crossing any context boundaries. Consider placing the JSON block on the page as a normal element and then parsing the innerHTML to get the contents. The JavaScript that reads the span can live in an external file, thus making the implementation of [CSP](https://content-security-policy.com/) enforcement easier.

```html
<div id="init_data" style="display: none">
 <%= html_encode(data.to_json) %>
</div>
```

```javascript
// external js file
var dataElement = document.getElementById('init_data');
// decode and parse the content of the div
var initData = JSON.parse(dataElement.textContent);
```

An alternative to encoding and decoding JSON directly in JavaScript, is to normalize JSON server-side by converting `<` to `\u003c` before delivering it to the browser.

---

### RULE \#4 - `CSS Encode And Strictly Validate` Before Inserting Untrusted Data into `HTML Style Property Values`
- to put untrusted data into a style sheet or a style tag.
- CSS is surprisingly powerful, and can be used for numerous attacks. Therefore, it's important to use untrusted data in a property **value** and not into other places in style data.
- You should stay away from putting untrusted data into complex properties like `url`, `behavior`, and custom (`-moz-binding`).
- You should also not put untrusted data into IE's expression property value which allows JavaScript.

Property value:

```html
<style>
selector { property : ...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...; }
</style>
```

```html
<style>
selector { property : "...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE..."; }
</style>
```

```html
<span style="property : ...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...">text</span>
```

- there are some CSS contexts that can never safely use untrusted data as input - **EVEN IF PROPERLY CSS ENCODED!**
- You will have to ensure that
    - URLs only start with `http` not `javascript`
    - properties never start with `"expression"`.

For example:

```cs
{ background-url : "javascript:alert(1)"; }  //and all other URLs
{ text-size: "expression(alert('XSS'))"; }   //only in IE
```

- Except for alphanumeric characters, encode all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with the `\HH` encoding format.
- **DO NOT** use any escaping shortcuts like `\"` because the quote character may be matched by the HTML attribute parser which runs first. These escaping shortcuts are also susceptible to **escape-the-escape attacks** where the attacker sends `\"` and the vulnerable code turns that into `\\"` which enables the quote.

- If attribute is quoted, breaking out requires the corresponding quote. All attributes should be quoted but your encoding should be strong enough to prevent XSS when untrusted data is placed in unquoted contexts.

- Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters including `[space]` `%` `*` `+` `,` `-` `/` `;` `<` `=` `>` `^` and `|`.

- Also, the `</style>` tag will close the style block even though it is inside a quoted string
    - because the HTML parser runs before the JavaScript parser.
- recommend `aggressive CSS encoding and validation` to prevent XSS attacks for both quoted and unquoted attributes.

---

### RULE \#5 - `URL Encode` Before Inserting Untrusted Data into `HTML URL Parameter Values`
- to put untrusted data into HTTP GET parameter value.

```html
<a href="http://www.somesite.com?test=...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...">link</a >
```

- Except for alphanumeric characters, encode all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with the `%HH` encoding format. Including untrusted data in `data:` URLs should not be allowed as there is no good way to disable attacks with encoding/escaping to prevent switching out of the URL.

- All attributes should be quoted.
- Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters including `[space]` `%` `*` `+` `,` `-` `/` `;` `<` `=` `>` `^` and `|`.
    - Note that `entity encoding` is useless in this context.

- WARNING: Do not encode complete or relative URLs with URL encoding!
- If untrusted input is meant to be placed into `href`, `src` or other URL-based attributes,
    - it should be validated
    - to make sure it does not point to an unexpected protocol, especially `javascript` links.
    - URLs should then be encoded based on the context of display like any other piece of data.
- For example
    - user driven URLs in `HREF` links should be attribute encoded.

For example:

```java
String userURL = request.getParameter( "userURL" )
boolean isValidURL = Validator.IsValidURL(userURL, 255);
if (isValidURL) {
    <a href="<%=encoder.encodeForHTMLAttribute(userURL)%>">link</a>
}
```

---

### RULE \#6 - `Sanitize HTML Markup` with a Library Designed for the Job
- If your application handles markup -- untrusted input that is supposed to contain HTML -- it can be very difficult to validate.
- Encoding is also difficult, since it would break all the tags that are supposed to be in the input.
- Therefore, you need a library that can parse and clean HTML formatted text.
- There are several available at OWASP that are simple to use:

**[HtmlSanitizer](https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer)**

An open-source .Net library. The HTML is cleaned with a white list approach. All allowed tags and attributes can be configured. The library is unit tested with the OWASP [XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet)

```csharp
var sanitizer = new HtmlSanitizer();
sanitizer.AllowedAttributes.Add("class");
var sanitized = sanitizer.Sanitize(html);
```

**[OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer](https://owasp.org/www-project-java-html-sanitizer/)**

```java
import org.owasp.html.Sanitizers;
import org.owasp.html.PolicyFactory;
PolicyFactory sanitizer = Sanitizers.FORMATTING.and(Sanitizers.BLOCKS);
String cleanResults = sanitizer.sanitize("<p>Hello, <b>World!</b>");
```

For more information on OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer policy construction, see [here](https://github.com/OWASP/java-html-sanitizer).

**[Ruby on Rails SanitizeHelper](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html)**

The `SanitizeHelper` module provides a set of methods for scrubbing text of undesired HTML elements.

``` rub
<%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: %w(strong em a), attributes: %w(href) %>
```

**Other libraries that provide HTML Sanitization include:**

- [HTML sanitizer](https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/master/closure/goog/html/sanitizer/htmlsanitizer.js) from [Google Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) (JavaScript/Node.js, [docs](https://google.github.io/closure-library/api/goog.html.sanitizer.HtmlSanitizer.html))
- [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) (JavaScript, requires [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) for Node.js)
- [PHP HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/)
- [Python Bleach](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach)

---

### RULE \#7 - Avoid JavaScript URLs
- Untrusted URLs that include the protocol javascript: will execute JavaScript code when used in URL DOM locations such as anchor tag HREF attributes or iFrame src locations.
- Be sure to validate all untrusted URLs to ensure they only contain safe schemes such as HTTPS.

---

### RULE \#8 - Prevent DOM-based XSS
- For details on what DOM-based XSS is, and defenses against this type of XSS flaw, please see the OWASP article on [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md).

---

### Bonus Rule \#1: `Use HTTPOnly cookie flag`
- set the `HTTPOnly` flag on session cookie and any custom cookies that are not accessed by any JavaScript you wrote.
- This cookie flag is typically on by default in `.NET` apps, but in other languages you have to set it manually.
- For more details [HTTPOnly](https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly).

---

### Bonus Rule \#2: Implement `Content Security Policy`
- a browser side mechanism
- create source whitelists for client side resources of your web application,
    - e.g. JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.
- CSP via special HTTP header instructs the browser to only execute or render resources from those sources.

For example this CSP:

```c
Content-Security-Policy: default-src: 'self'; script-src: 'self' static.domain.tld
```

Will instruct web browser to load
- all resources only from the page's origin
- and JavaScript source code files additionally from `static.domain.tld`.
- For more details [Content Security Policy](https://content-security-policy.com).

---

### Bonus Rule \#3: Use an Auto-Escaping Template System
- Many web application frameworks provide automatic contextual escaping functionality such as [AngularJS strict contextual escaping](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$sce) and [Go Templates](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/).

---

### Bonus Rule \#4: Properly use `modern JS frameworks`
- Modern JavaScript frameworks have pretty good XSS protection built in.
- Usually framework API allows bypassing that protection in order to render unescaped HTML or include executable code.
- keep framework updated to the latest version with all possible bugfixes.

- The following API methods and props in the table below are considered dangerous
    - potentially exposing users to an XSS vulnerability.
    - If **really** have to use them, now all the data must be [sanitized](#rule-6---sanitize-html-markup-with-a-library-designed-for-the-job) by yourself.

| JavaScript framework | Dangerous methods / props                                                                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Angular (2+)         | [bypassSecurityTrust](https://angular.io/guide/security#bypass-security-apis)                  |
| React                | [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#dangerouslysetinnerhtml)|
| Svelte               | [`{@html ...}`](https://svelte.dev/docs#html)                                                  |
| Vue (2+)             | [`v-html`](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#v-html)                                                   |

Avoid template injection in Angular by building with `--prod` parameter (`ng build --prod`).

---

### X-XSS-Protection Header

The `X-XSS-Protection` header has been deprecated by modern browsers and its use can introduce **additional** security issues on the client side.
- As such, it is recommended to set the header as `X-XSS-Protection: 0` in order to disable the XSS Auditor, and not allow it to take the default behavior of the browser handling the response.
- Check the below references for a better understanding on this topic:

- [Google Chrome’s XSS Auditor goes back to filter mode](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-chromes-xss-auditor-goes-back-to-filter-mode)
- [Chrome removed the XSS Auditor](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5021976655560704)
- [Firefox does not implement the XSSAuditor](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=528661)
- [Edge retired their XSS filter](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/07/25/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17723-and-build-18204/)
- [OWASP ZAP deprecated the scan for the header](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5849)
- [SecurityHeaders.com no longer scans for the header](https://scotthelme.co.uk/security-headers-updates/#removing-the-x-xss-protection-header)

## XSS Prevention Rules Summary

| DataType | Context  | Code Sample | Defense |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| String | HTML Body |  `<span>BAD DATA</span>` | HTML Entity Encoding (rule \#1) |
| String | Safe HTML Attributes | `<input type="text" name="fname" value="BAD DATA">` | Aggressive HTML Entity Encoding (rule \#2) <br> Only place untrusted data into a whitelist of safe attributes (listed below), Strictly validate unsafe attributes such as background, ID and name. |

The following snippets of HTML demonstrate how to safely render untrusted data in a variety of different contexts.

- **Safe HTML Attributes include:**
- `align`, `alink`, `alt`, `bgcolor`, `border`, `cellpadding`, `cellspacing`, `class`, `color`, `cols`, `colspan`, `coords`, `dir`, `face`, `height`, `hspace`, `ismap`, `lang`, `marginheight`, `marginwidth`, `multiple`, `nohref`, `noresize`, `noshade`, `nowrap`, `ref`, `rel`, `rev`, `rows`, `rowspan`, `scrolling`, `shape`, `span`, `summary`, `tabindex`, `title`, `usemap`, `valign`, `value`, `vlink`, `vspace`, `width`.

## Output Encoding Rules Summary

The purpose of output encoding (as it relates to Cross Site Scripting) is to convert untrusted input into a safe form where the input is displayed as **data** to the user without executing as **code** in the browser. The following charts details a list of critical output encoding methods needed to stop Cross Site Scripting.

| Encoding Type | Encoding Mechanism |
|---------------|--------------------|
| **HTML Entity Encoding**    | `& = &amp;`, `< = &lt;`, `> = &gt;`, `" = &quot;`, `' = &#x27;`, `/ = &#x2F;` |
| **HTML Attribute Encoding** | Except for alphanumeric characters, encode all characters with the HTML Entity `&#xHH;` format, including spaces. (**HH** = Hex Value) |
| **URL Encoding**            | Standard percent encoding, see [here](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp). URL encoding should only be used to encode parameter values, not the entire URL or path fragments of a URL. |
| **JavaScript Encoding**     | Except for alphanumeric characters, encode all characters with the `\uXXXX` unicode encoding format (**X** = Integer).  |
| **CSS Hex Encoding**        | CSS encoding supports `\XX` and `\XXXXXX`. Using a two character encode can cause problems if the next character continues the encode sequence.  There are two solutions (a) Add a space after the CSS encode (will be ignored by the CSS parser) (b) use the full amount of CSS encoding  possible by zero padding the value. |
