# Boto3


## Installation

```bash
pip install boto3
pip3 install boto3 botostubs
pip install boto3==1.0.0

$ aws configure
$ aws configure --profile produser
AWS Access Key ID [None]: aa
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: bb/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json


~/.aws/credentials
```


## Configuration

Before you can begin using Boto3, set up authentication credentials.

```bash
# If you have the AWS CLI installed, then you can use it to configure credentials file:
aws configure

# can create the credential fileself.
# By default, its location is at ~/.aws/credentials:
[default]
aws_access_key_id =_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key =_SECRET_KEY

# You may also want to set a default region.
# This can be done in the configuration file. By default, its location is at ~/.aws/config:
[default]
region=us-east-1

# Alternatively, you can pass a region_name when creating clients and resources.

# This sets up credentials for the default profile as well as a default region to use when creating connections.
```


## Using Boto3


```py
# import it and tell it what service you are going to use:

import boto3

# use Amazon S3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

# Now that you have an s3 resource, you can make requests and process responses from the service.
# The following uses the buckets collection to print out all bucket names:
# Print out bucket names
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)


# It's also easy to upload and download binary data.
# For example, the following uploads a new file to S3.
# It assumes that the bucket my-bucket already exists:
# Upload a new file
data = open('test.jpg', 'rb')
s3.Bucket('my-bucket').put_object(Key='test.jpg', Body=data)
```
