## 2 VPC infrastructure


2 primary patterns for organizing VPC infrastructure:  
- Multi-VPC or Multi-Account

![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 06.18.43](https://i.imgur.com/tZ7Xrl4.png)

- The Multi-VPC pattern:
  - shared services, development, test, and production each have their own VPC. easier to maintain for smaller organizations.
  - Best suited for:
  - single team or for organizations, such as Managed Service Providers, MSPs who manage all resources in test and production.
    - maintain full control over the provisioning and management of all resources in each application environment.
  - Limited teams make maintaining standards and managing access far easier.
    - single team developing a large e-commerce application might use this pattern, when the developers have full access to the development and production environments.
  - Exception: governance and compliance standards that require workload isolation, regardless of organizational complexity.
- the Multi-Account pattern:
  - can have multiple Amazon web services accounts with the same information—such as shared services, development, test and production—instead of having multiple VPCs.
  - best suited for
  - larger organizations, organizations with multiple IT teams
  - medium-sized organizations that anticipate rapid growth.
  - managing access and standards can be challenging in more complex organizations.
  - consider where your team will be in five years.
  - It's easier with larger companies to manage with multiple accounts, versus having everything inside of one account with multiple VPCs.

**The majority of AWS services do not actually sit within a VPC**
- EC2 instances are configured with public IP addresses
  - But network traffic between AWS Regions traverse the AWS global network backbone by default,
  - which typically provides more consistent, lower-latency network connectivity than equivalent internet-based connections.
  - On occasion, some traffic between Regions uses the public internet.
  - If use public internet for to connect to services like S3 or DynamoDB, should use a VPC endpoint.
  - use a VPC endpoint to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and to VPC endpoint services that are powered by PrivateLink without using an internet gateway; NAT device; VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
- Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service.
  - Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.

## basic

1. a service provision a **logically isolated section** of the AWS Cloud (virtual private cloud/VPC) to launch your AWS resources.
   - Analogous to having your own DC inside AWS.
     - VPC is logically isolated from other VPCs on AWS.
     - Possible to connect the corporate data centre to a VPC using a hardware VPN (site-to-site)
   - can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in VPC for secure access to resources and applications
   - **Full complete control over virtual networking resources**:
     - the selection of your own IP address range,
     - the creation of subnets,
     - and the configuration of route tables and network gateways.
     - customize the network configuration for VPC.
     - example,
       - create a public subnet for web servers that can access the public internet.
       - place backend systems (databases/application servers...) in a private subnet with no public internet access.
       - use multiple layers of security (security groups and network access control lists (networkACLs)...) to control access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in each subnet.
2. <kbd>account > one Region > a default VPC > AZs > a default subnet</kbd>
3. A VPC is dedicated to your account when create the account
   - When create VPC, it belong to a single Region
     - auto created for each AWS account the first time EC2 resources are provisioned.
   - VPCs are region wide.
     - span all AZs in 1 region
     - By default can create up to 5 VPCs per region.
   - AZs
     - After create, a VPC can divide it into more subnets in each AZ,
     - Each subnet must reside entirely within 1 AZ and cannot span zones.
     - A default VPC is created in a region with a public subnet in each AZ.
     - Instances in the default VPC always have both a public and private IP address.
     - AZs names are mapped to different zones for different users (i.e. the AZ “ap-southeast-2a” may map to a different physical zone for a different user).
4. default VPCs:
   - CIDR
     - default CIDR range is `172.31.0.0/16`
     - max size of a VPC is `/16`. The min is `/28`.
     - **The first 4 IP addresses and the last IP address in each CIDR block are reserved by AWS**.
     - Once the VPC is created, cannot change the CIDR block.
     - cannot create additional CIDR blocks that overlap with existing CIDR blocks.
     - cannot create additional CIDR blocks in a different RFC 1918 range.
     - IPv6 addresses are all public and the range is allocated by AWS.
   - entities are included when a default VPC is created
     - DHCP
     - Public subnet
     - default subnet,
     - an IGW internet gateway,
     - a main route table (connects the default subnet to the internet gateway),
     - a security group
     - a default NACL.
   - create a VPC-based resource (EC2, RDS, ELB, etc.) without specify a custom VPC, it will be placed in default VPC in that Region.
     - In general, this situation is not a good because many people know the default CIDR range, and that those ranges are automatically connected to internet gateways by default unless they are disabled.
   - Default VPCs are configurable like other VPCs.
     - For example, you can add more subnets.
5. Default subnets:
   - default subnets are created within each AZ for each default VPC.
   - public subnet with CIDR block of /20 (4,096 IP addresses).
     - Public subnets are subnets that have:
       - Private subnets
       - VPN-only subnet
     - Can be converted into a private subnet by `removing its route to the internet gateway`.
     - the default subnet and the default VPC. Many people might know how to use these default credentials, not secure.
   - When new AZ is added to a region, default VPC in that region gets a subnet placed in the new AZ (unless you've made modifications to that VPC)
     - New subnets are always associated with the default route table.


6. Default VPCs are a quick start solution.
   - provide an easy way to test launching instances of your VPC-based resources without having to set up a new VPC.
   - For real-world applications, create your own VPCs and subnets.
   - have greater control and knowledge of their configurations.
   - It’s possible to re-establish a default VPC if it’s accidentally deleted.


7. limited use cases work best with single VPC
   - `High-performance computing environments`: as a single VPC environment will have lower latency than one that’s spread across multiple VPCs.
   - `The use of Microsoft Active directory for identity management`: for the strongest security measures.
   - `For small, single app that managed by one person or very small team`: easiest to use one Virtual Private Cloud.


8. can define dedicated tenancy for a VPC to ensure instances are launched on dedicated hardware (overrides the configuration specified at launch).


9. Most AWS service do not reside in the VPC.
   - Use a `VPC endpoint` to access S3:
     - to provide secure access to an S3 bucket not using the internet
     - access to S3 resources from within a VPC by a VPC endpoint.
   - These endpoints are
     - easy to configure,
     - highly reliable,
     - provide a secure connection to S3 that does not require a gateway or NAT instances.


10.	to capture information about IP or any traffic flowing in VPC, use VPC Flow Logs.

11.	benefits of a VPC
    - two types of VPCs: custom and default.
    - option to create a VPC in many regions.
    - Provides a virtual private data center inside the AWS platform
    - can isolate malware by VPC isolation.

￼￼

## custom VPC
- make a subnet public
  - `Create an IGW` and attach it to the VPC
    - By default, custom VPCs do not automatically come with <kbd>IGWs (Internet Gateways)</kbd>
  - `Add a route` on the associated route table to forward internet bound traffic to the IGW
  - Enabling a subnet to `auto-assign public IPs`
    - allow all resources provisioned in this subnet to have a public IP by default as opposed to just having a private IP.


To enable access to or from the Internet for instances in a VPC subnet, you must do the following:
- `Attach an Internet Gateway` to VPC.
- Ensure that `subnet’s route table points to the Internet Gateway`
  - **To all destinations**
    - `0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4
    - `::/0` for IPv6.
  - **To specific public IPv4 addresses**
    - your company’s public endpoints outside of AWS.
- Ensure that `instances in subnet have a globally unique IP address`
  - (public IPv4 address, Elastic IP address, or IPv6 address).
- Ensure that `network access control and security group rules allow the relevant traffic` to flow to and from your instance.

## Route table



The VPC router
- performs routing between AZs within a region.
- connects different AZs together and connects the VPC to the Internet Gateway.


route table
- a map that tells you how to enter and leave your network.
  - It contains a set of rules, routes
  - to determine where network traffic is directed.
  - Route tables also have entries to external destinations.
    - `Up to 200 route tables per VPC.`
    - `Up to 50 route entries per route table.`


- have <font colore=red> main route tables (default), and custom route tables </font>
  - When create a VPC, it automatically has a main route table.
  - you can use custom route table if you need infrastructure within VPC that can connect back to your on-premises environment.


default
- Every VPC has a default route table when be created.
  - Default VPC already has a main route table
    - <font color=blue> Cannot delete </font> the main route table.
  - If no route table is specified, a subnet will be assigned to the main route table at creation time.
  - can manually set another route table to become the main route table.


- All route tables in VPC include a single route: <font color=red> a local route entry </font>
  - a default rule (local route)
    - enables communication within the VPC.
      - allows all VPC subnets to communicate with one another
    - cannot be deleted or modified.
    - Routing between subnets is always possible because of this rule
    - any problems communicating is more likely to be security groups or NACLs.
  - launch an instance in VPC, the local route automatically covers that instance. don't need to add the new instance to route table.


subnet
- Each subnet has a route table the router uses to forward traffic within the VPC
  - <font color=blue> Each subnet can only be associated with one route table </font>
  - <font color=blue> route table can be share between subnets </font>
    - Can assign one route table to multiple subnets.


- Each subnet must be associated with a route table
  - controls the routing for the subnet.
  - forward traffic within the VPC
  - <font color=blue> one subnet can only be associated with one route table </font>
  - <font color=blue> route table can be share between subnets </font>
    - Can assign one route table to multiple subnets.

  - If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table, the subnet is implicitly associated with and uses the main route table (default).
  - best practice: use custom route tables for each subnet.
    - enables granular routing for destinations.
