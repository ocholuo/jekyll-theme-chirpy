## Security in EC2

1. Controlling network access to the instances, 
   - for example, through configuring your VPC and security groups.

2. Managing the credentials used to connect to the instances.

3. Managing the guest operating system and software deployed to the guest operating system, including updates and security patches.  

4. Configuring the IAM roles that are attached to the instance and the permissions associated with those roles.
