# PKI Public Key Infrastructure 


public key encryption’s major strength: 
- ability to facilitate communication between parties previously unknown to each other. 
  - facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information for a range of network activities 
    - such as e-commerce, internet banking and confidential email. 
- Made possible by (PKI) public key infrastructure 基础设施 hierarchy 等级制度 of trust relationships.
- able to find and access public keys on demand.

A public key infrastructure (PKI)
1. a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed 
   - to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke keys and digital certificates safely and securely.

2. the component of PKI:
   - Certificate authority (CA): 
     - the entity responsible for <font color=red> enrollment, creation, management, validation and revocation of digital certificates </font>
     - key element in a PKI
   - Registration authority (RA): 
     - the entity responsible for accepting info about a party wishing to obtain a certificate
     - RAs generally do not issue or manage certificates.
     - entities known as local registration authorities (LRAs) are delegated the ability to issue certificate by a CA.
   - Certificate revocation list (CRL): 
     - a list of revoked certificates, published by CA.
   - Digital certificates: 
     - prices of information. 
     - Used to positively prove the identity.
   - Certificate distribution system: 
     - a combination of software, hardware, services, and procedures used to distribute certificates.
     - A PKI is made up of hardware, applications, policies, services, programming interfaces, cryptographic algorithms, protocols, users, and utilities. 

3. implementing a PKI boils down to establishing a level of trust.  
   - These trusts permit combining asymmetric cryptography with symmetric cryptography along with hashing and digital certificates, giving us hybrid cryptography.
   - Asymmetric encryption depends on the use of certificates for a variety of purposes:
     - protecting email and Internet traffic with SSL and TLS. 
     - HTTPS sessions protect Internet credit card transactions, and these transactions depend on a PKI.

4. primary benefit of a PKI: 
   - allows two people or entities to <font color=red>  communicate securely without knowing each other previously </font>
   - allows  <font color=red> communicate securely through an insecure public medium </font>
     - like Internet
   - small groups: 
     - possible for users to exchange public keys based on a previously established level of trust.
   - big organizations: 
     - PKI provides solution: provides a mechanism through which keys can be generated and bound to a digital certificate that can be viewed and validated by all parties.
   - Example
     - establish a secure session with Amazon.com even if you’ve never done so before. 
     - Amazon purchased a certificate from Symantec. 
     - the certificate provides the ability to establish a secure session.


5. public keys must be distributed or stored in a secure manner
   - prevents the keys from being tampered with or altered in any way.
