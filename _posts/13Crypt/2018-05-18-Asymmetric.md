# Asymmetric Encryption

- also called Public-Key Encryption.
  - Two-key systems are referred to as public key cryptography (PKC)
- In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin R. Hellman published the first public key exchange protocol
- Asymmetric key cryptography relies on NP-hard problem:
  - a math problem is considered NP-hard if it cannot be solved in polynomial time.
  - X^2, X^3, NP-hard problem: 2^X.
- Asymmetric cryptography relies on types of problem that are relatively easy to solve one way but are extremely difficult to solve the other way. (Trapdoor function)
  - 233x347=80851
  - 80851=?x? (Hard)


- adders the most serious problem of symmetric encryption: key distribution.
  - no fear of authorized key disclosure.



## major advantage:
- <font color=red> Key distribution </font> is a simple process
  - The addition of new users requires the generation of only one public-private keypair.
    - makes the algorithm extremely scalable.
    - Users who want to participate in the system simply make their public key available to anyone with whom they want to communicate.
    - There is no method the private key can be derived from the public key.
  - Users can be removed far more easily from asymmetric systems.
    - Asymmetric cryptosystems provide a key revocation mechanism that allows a key to be canceled, effectively removing a user from the system.

- <font color=red> Key regeneration </font>
  - required only when a user’s private key is compromised.
  - If a user leaves the community, the system administrator simply needs to invalidate that user’s keys.
  - No other keys are compromised, therefore key regeneration is not required for any other user.

- <font color=red> provide integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation </font>
  - If a user does not share their private key with other individuals, a message signed by that user can be shown to be accurate and from a specific source and cannot be later repudiated.

- <font color=red> No preexisting communication link needs to exist </font>
  - individuals can begin communicating securely from the moment they start communicating.
  - does not require a preexisting relationship to provide a secure mechanism for data exchange.


## disadvantage:
- very strong, but very <font color=red> resource intensive </font>
  - takes a significant amount of processing power to encrypt and decrypt data,
  - especially when compared with symmetric encryption.
- higher security but <font color=red> slower </font>
  - not for large quantities of real-time data.
  - might be used to encrypt a small chunk of data.
- Most cryptographic protocols use asymmetric encryption only for <font color=red> key exchange </font>
  - secure transmission of large amounts of data use <font color=blue> public key cryptography to establish a connection and then exchange a symmetric secret key </font>
  - The remainder of the session then uses symmetric cryptography.
  - Key exchange:
    - share cryptographic keys between two entities.
    - use asymmetric encryption to key exchange, share a symmetric key.
    - uses the symmetric encryption to encrypt and decrypt data (much more efficient).

- uses asymmetric (different) keys for the sender and the receiver.
  - C = EPB (M)
  - M = DSB (C)

- Once the sender encrypts the message with the recipient’s public key, no user (including the sender) can decrypt that message without knowing the recipient’s private key.
  - public keys can be freely shared using unsecured communications
  - create secure communications between users previously unknown to each other.

- public key cryptography entails a higher degree of computational complexity. Keys must be longer than those used in private key systems to produce cryptosystems of equivalent strengths.
- example:
  - authenticate the other party in a conversation
  - or to exchange a shared key to be used during a session (after which, the parties in the conversation could start using symmetric encryption).

## pretty good privacy (PGP):
often used to encrypt e-mail traffic. A free variant of PGP is GNU Privacy Guard (GPC).

example:
- when client A wants to communicate securely with server 1.
  - Client A requests server 1’s digital certificate.
  - Server 1 sends its digital certificate,
  - client A knows the received certificate is really from server 1.
    - because the certificate has been authenticated (signed) by a trusted third party, called a certificate authority.
  - Client A extracts 提取 server 1’s public key from server 1’s digital certificate.
    - Data encrypted using server 1’s public key can only be decrypted with server 1’s private key.
  - Client A generates a random string of data called a session key.
    - The session key is then encrypted using server 1’s public key and sent to server 1.
  - Server 1 decrypts the session key using its private key.
	At this point, both client A and server 1 know the session key, use it to symmetrically encrypt traffic during the session.

## Diffie-Hellman (DH)

Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman first published the Diffie-Hellman scheme in 1976.
- Interestingly, Malcolm J. Williamson secretly created a similar algorithm while working in a British intelligence agency. It is widely believed that the work of these three provided the basis for public-key cryptography.

a key exchange algorithm
- to privately share a symmetric key between two parties.
- Once the two parties know the symmetric key, they use symmetric encryption to encrypt the data.


Diffie-Hellman methods
- uses large integers and modular arithmetic
- support both static keys and ephemeral keys.
  - RSA is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange concepts using static keys.
- Diffie-Hellman methods that use ephemeral keys are:
  - <font color=red> Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) </font>
    - uses ephemeral keys, generating different keys for each session.
    - Some documents list this as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (EDH).
  - <font color=red> Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) </font>
    - uses ephemeral keys generated using ECC.
  - <font color=red> Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) </font>
    - uses static keys.

When Diffie-Hellman is used, the two parties negotiate the strongest group that both parties support.
- There are currently more than 25 DH (Diffie Hellman) groups in use
- defined as DH Group 1, DH Group 2, and so on.
- Higher group more secure.
- Example
  - DH Group 1 uses 768 bits in the key exchange process
  - DH Group 15 uses 3,072 bits.

## RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

inventors: Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard M. Adleman.
- They patented their algorithm and formed a commercial venture known as RSA Security to develop mainstream implementations of their security technology.
- early public key encryption system that uses large integers as the basis for the process
- patented in 1977, released its patent to the public about 48 hours before it expired in 2002.

RSA algorithm:
- asymmetric encryption
- security backbone of many well-known security infrastructures: Microsoft, Nokia, and Cisco.
- RSA works with both encryption and digital signatures, used in many environments,
  - like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and key exchange.
  - commonly used as part of a public key infrastructure (PKI) system.
    - PKI uses <font color=blue> digital certificates and a certificate authority (CA) </font> to allow secure communication across a public network.
    - But ECDH better in PKI for key agreement.


- based on <font color=red> factoring 2 larger primes </font>
  - the computational difficulty inherent in factoring large prime numbers.
  - uses the mathematical properties of prime numbers to generate secure public and private keys.
  - it is difficult to factor the product of two large prime numbers.

- RSA is secure if sufficient key sizes are used.
  - RSA laboratories recommend a key size of 2,048 bits to protect data through the year 2030.
  - If data needs to be protected beyond 2030, they recommend a key size of 3,072 bits.


### Disadvantages:
- much slower than the those for existing symmetric encryption schemes.
- Require in practice a key length larger than that for symmetric cryptosystems.
  - RSA: 2048-bit keys
  - AES: 256-bit keys.




```
a 除以 m 所得的余数记作 a mod m.
如果 a mod m = b mod m
即 a, b 除以 m 所得的余数相等，那么我们记作：a≡b(mod m)
```

### key generation:

```bash
# 1. Choose two large prime numbers p,q (approximately 200 digits each): p and q, of approximately equal size such that their product, n = pq, is of the required bit length (such as 2,048 bits, 4,096 bits, and so forth).

# 2. Compute the product of those two numbers:
   n = p * q.
   m = (p-1)(q-1)

# 3. Select a number, e, that satisfies the following two requirements:
   e < n.
   e  co-prime to m.  (2 numbers have no common factors other than 1.)

# 4. Find d:  
  (ed – 1) mod (p – 1)(q – 1) = 0.
  de mod m ≡ 1 		

# 5. Distribute e and n as the public key to all cryptosystem users.

# 6. Keep d secret as the private key.


If Alice wants to send an encrypted message to Bob,
Alice generates the ciphertext (C) from the plain text (P):
C = P^e mod n
# e is Bob’s public key
# n is the product of p and q created during the key generation process
When Bob receives the message, he retrieve the plaintext message:
P = C^d mod n

To make this even more clear, let’s look at an example:
1. Select primes: p = 17 and q =11
1. Compute n = pq =17×11 = 187
1. Compute ø(n) = (p–1)(q-1) = 16×10 = 160
1. Select e = 7
1. Find d, such that de mod m ≡ 1, d = 23
1. Since 23×7 = 161 mod M (160) = 1
1. Publish public key 7
1. Keep secret private key 23
1. Now let’s use these keys. Use the number 3 as the plain text. Remember e = 7, d = 23, and n = 187.
1. Cipher text = Plaintexte  mod n = 37 mod 187                   = 2187 mod 187 = 130
1. Plaintext = Cipher textd  mod nPlaintext = 13023 mod 187Plaintext = 4.1753905413413116367045797e+48mod 187
1. Plaintext = 3
```

## El Gamal

Diffie-Hellman: uses large integers and modular arithmetic to facilitate the secure exchange of secret keys over insecure communications channels.

In 1985, Dr. T. El Gamal
- how the mathematical principles behind the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm could be extended to support an entire public key cryptosystem used for encrypting/decrypting messages.
- Dr. El Gamal did not obtain a patent on his extension of Diffie-Hellman, and it is freely available for use, unlike the then-patented RSA technology. (RSA released its algorithm into the public domain in 2000.)


el Gamal:
- based on Diffie-Hellman, relies on discrete logarithms.


one of the major advantages of El Gamal over the RSA algorithm:
- it was released into the public domain.

Major disadvantage:
- the algorithm doubles the length of any message it encrypts.
- Hard when encrypting long messages/data then transmitte over a narrow bandwidth communications circuit.
