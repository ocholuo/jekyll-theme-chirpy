## Google Cloud Storage

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 23.55.15](https://i.imgur.com/q9OtPjX.png)

- a fully managed scalable service. don't need to provision capacity ahead of time.

- often the ingestion point for data being moved into the cloud
  - allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time

- the long-term storage location for data.

- Cloud storage can
  - store App Engine logs, cloud data store backups, and objects used by App Engine applications like images.
  - store instant startup scripts, Compute Engine images, and objects used by Compute Engine applications.
  - serving website content,
  - storing data for archival and disaster recovery,
  - distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

- Cloud Storage is comprised of buckets and configure and use to hold the storage objects.

- object storage
  - you save to the storage here
  - you keep this arbitrary bunch of bytes I give you and the storage lets you address it with a unique key.
  - Often these unique keys are in the form of URLs which means object storage interacts nicely with Web technologies.
  - make objects and the service stores them with high durability and high availability. 

- Cloud Storage is not:
  - not a file system 
    - object storage, each of the objects in Cloud Storage has a URL.
    - file storage, manage the data as a hierarchy of folders.
    - block storage, the operating system manages the data as chunks of disk.
  - would not use Cloud Storage as the root file system of the Linux box.
 
- Cloud Storage encrypts the data on the server side before it is written to disk
  - you don't pay extra for that.
  - by default, data in-transit is encrypted using HTTPS.
- Once they are in Cloud Storage, you can move them onwards to other GCP storage services.



## buckets.

- buckets.
  - globally unique name.
  - specify a geographic location where the bucket and its contents
    - Pick a location that minimizes latency for the users.
  - and you choose a default storage class.

- <font color=red> The storage objects </font>
  - immutable,
    - do not edit them in place but instead create new versions
    - turn on object versioning on the buckets
      - keeps a history of modifications.
      - it overrides or deletes all of the objects in the bucket.
      - can list the archived versions of an object,
      - restore an object to an older state
      - or permanently delete a version as needed.
    - don't turn on object versioning,
      - new always overrides old.
  - lifecycle management policies.
    - For example
    - tell Cloud Storage to delete objects older than 365 days.
    - tell it to delete objects created before January 1, 2013
    - or keep only the three most recent versions of each object in a bucket that has versioning enabled.




## access to the objects and buckets.

- Cloud IAM
- Roles: inherited from project to bucket to object.
- access control lists - ACLs
  - offer finer control.
  - ACLs define who has access to the buckets and objects as well as what level of access they have.
  - Each ACL consists of two pieces of information,
    - scope
      - defines who can perform the specified actions,
      - for example, a specific user or group of users
    - permission
      - defines what actions can be performed.
      - For example, read or write.

## storage classes:


![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 22.38.07](https://i.imgur.com/zQFaWOA.png)


Regional, Multi-regional, Nearline, and Coldline.  


- Multi-regional and Regional are high-performance object storage
- Nearline and Coldline are backup and archival storage.  
- All of the storage classes are accessed in comparable ways using the cloud storage API and they all offer millisecond access times.  


- pricing
  - all storage classes incur a cost per gigabyte of data stored per month
    - Multi-regional having the highest storage price
    - Coldline the lowest storage price.
  - Egress and data transfer charges may also apply.
  - Nearline storage also incurs an access fee per gigabyte of data read
  - Coldline storage incurs a higher fee per gigabyte of data read.

### Multi-regional storage `99.95 percent`
- cost a bit more
- but it's Geo-redundant.
- you pick a broad geographical location like the United States, the European Union, or Asia and cloud storage stores your data in at least two geographic locations separated by at least 160 kilometers.
- appropriate for storing frequently accessed data.
  - For example,
  - website content, interactive workloads,
  - or data that's part of mobile and gaming applications.

### Regional storage `99.9 percent Availability`
- store data in a specific GCP region:
  - US Central one, Europe West one or Asia East one.
- cheaper than Multi-regional storage
- but it offers less redundancy.
- to store data close to their Compute Engine, virtual machines, or their Kubernetes engine clusters.
  - gives better performance for data-intensive computations.

### Nearline storage `99 percent Availability`
- low-cost, highly durable service
- for storing infrequently accessed data.  
  - For example,
  - when plan to read or modify the data once a month or less on average.
  - continuously add files to cloud storage and access those files once a month for analysis

###  Coldline storage `99 percent Availability`
- very low cost, highly durable service
- for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.
- the best choice for data that you plan to access -at most- once a year.
- due to its slightly lower availability,
- 90-day minimum storage duration,
- costs for data access, and higher per operation costs.
- For example,
  - to archive data or have access to it in case of a disaster recovery event.

## bring data into cloud storage.

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 23.54.12](https://i.imgur.com/suMHyqx.png)

- bring data into cloud storage.
  - use gsutil
    - the cloud storage command from this cloud SDK.
  - drag and drop in the GCP console in browser.
  - for terabytes or even petabytes of data
    - online storage transfer service
      - schedule and manage batch transfers to cloud storage from another cloud provider from a different cloud storage region or from an HTTPS endpoint.
    - offline transfer appliance
      - a rackable, high-capacity storage server that you lease from Google Cloud.
      - connect it to your network, load it with data, and then ship it to an upload facility where the data is uploaded to cloud storage.
      - securely transfer up to a petabyte of data on a single appliance.  

- other ways of getting your data into cloud storage as this storage option is tightly integrated with many of the Google cloud platform products and services.
- For example
  - import and export tables from and to BigQuery as well as Cloud SQL.
