## Traditional: on-premises distributed systems architecture

![Screen Shot 2021-02-07 at 23.20.20](https://i.imgur.com/dX9TDe3.png)

> how business is traditionally made the enterprise computing needs before cloud computing.

- most enterprise scale applications are designed as distributed systems.
  - Spreading the computing workload required to provide services over two or more network servers.
  - containers can break these workloads down into microservices,
  - more easily maintained and expanded.

- <font color=red> on-premises systems </font>
  - Enterprise systems and workloads, containerized or not, have been housed on-premises,
  - a set of high-capacity servers running in the company's network or data center.
  - When an application's computing needs begin to outstrip its available computing resources
    - need to procure more powerful servers.
    - Install them on the company network after any necessary network changes or expansions.
    - Configure the new servers
    - and finally load the application and it's dependencies onto the new servers before resource bottlenecks could be resolved.
  - shortcut
    - The time required to complete an on-premises upgrade could be from months to years.
    - also costly, the useful lifespan of the average server is only three to five years.


> what if you need more computing power now, not months from now?
> 
> What if the company wants to begin to relocate some workloads away from on-premises to the Cloud to take advantage of lower cost and higher availability, but is unwilling or unable to move the enterprise application from the on-premises network?
> 
> What if you want to use specialized products and services that only available in the Cloud?
> 
> This is where a modern hybrid or multi-cloud architecture can help.

## Modern: hybrid on multi-cloud architecture

- creating an environment uniquely suited to the company's needs.
  - keep parts of the systems infrastructure on-premises
  - Move only specific workloads to the Cloud at the own pace
    - because a full scale migration is not required for it to work.

- benefits:
  - Take advantage of the cloud services for running the workloads you decide to migrate.
    - <font color=red> flexibility, scalability, and lower computing costs </font>
  - Add specialized services to the computing resources tool kit.
    - such as <font color=red> machine learning, content caching, data analysis, long-term storage, and IoT </font>

- the adoption of hybrid architecture for powering distributed systems and services.

# Anthos

---

## overview

- modern solution for <font color=blue> hybrid and multi-cloud distributed systems and service management </font>
  - powered by the latest innovations in distributed systems, and service management software from Google.
- On-permises and Cloud environments stay in sync
  - The Anthos framework rests on Kubernetes and GKE on-prem.
- provides
  - the foundation for an architecture
    - the foundation that is fully integrated with centralized management through a central control plane that supports <font color=blue> policy based application lifecycle </font> delivery across <font color=blue> hybrid and multi-cloud environments </font>
  - a rich set of tools
    - Manage sevices on-permises and in the cloud
    - monitor systems and services
      - for monitoring and maintaining the consistency of the applications across all network (on-premises, Cloud, multiple clouds)
    - migrate application from VMs into the clusters
    - maintain consistent policies across across all network (on-premises, Cloud, multiple clouds)

- <font color=red> Google Kubernetes Engine on the Cloud site </font> of the hybrid network.
  - Google Kubernetes Engine is a managed production-ready environment for <font color=blue> deploying containerized applications </font>
  - Operates seamlessly with high availability and an SLA.
  - Runs certified Kubernetes ensuring portability across clouds and on-premises.
  - Includes auto-node repair, and auto-upgrade, and auto-scaling.
  - Uses regional clusters for high availability with multiple masters.
  - Node storage replication across multiple zones.

- <font color=red> Google Kubernetes Engine deployed ON-PREM </font>
  - a turn-key production-grade conformed version of Kubernetes
  - with the best practice configuration already pre-loaded.
  - Provides
    - <font color=blue> easy upgrade path to the latest validated Kubernetes releases </font> by Google.
    - <font color=blue> Provides access to container services </font> on Google Cloud platform,
      - such as Cloud build, container registry, audit logging, and more.
    - <font color=blue> integrates with Istio, Knative and Marketplace Solutions </font>
  - Ensures a consistent Kubernetes version and experience across Cloud and on-premises environments.

- <font color=red> Marketplace </font>
  - both <font color=blue> Google Kubernetes Engine in the Cloud </font> and <font color=blue> Google Kubernetes Engine deployed on-premises </font> integrate with <font color=blue> Marketplace </font>
  - so all of the clusters in network (on-premises or in the Cloud), have access to the same repository of containerized applications.
  - benefits:
    - use the same configurations on both the sides of the network,
    - reducing the time spent developing applications.
    - use ones replicate anywhere
    - maintaining conformity between the clusters.

> Enterprise applications may use hundreds of microservices to handle computing workloads.
> Keeping track of all of these services and monitoring their health can quickly become a challenge.



- <font color=red> Anthos </font>
  - an Istio Open Source service mesh
  - take these guesswork out of managing and securing the microservices.

- <font color=red> Cloud interconnect </font>
  - These service mesh layers communicate across the hybrid network by Cloud interconnect
  - to sync and pass their data.

- <font color=red> Stackdriver </font>
  - the <font color=blue> built-in logging and monitoring solution </font> for Google Cloud.
    - offers a fully managed logging, metrics collection, monitoring dashboarding, and alerting solution that watches all sides of the hybrid on multi-cloud network.
  - the ideal solution for <font color=blue> single easy configure powerful cloud-based observability solution </font>
  - a single pane of class dashboard to monitor all of the environments.

- <font color=red> Anthos Configuration Management </font>
  - provides
    - a single source of truth for the clusters configuration.
      - source of truth is kept in the policy repository, a git repository.
      - this repository can be located on-premises or in the Cloud.
    - deploy code changes with a single repository commit.
    - implement configuration inheritance, by using namespaces.

- <font color=red> Anthos Configuration Management agents </font>
  - use the policy repository to enforce configurations locally in each environment,
  - managing the complexity of owning clusters across environments.
