- serverless 
- builds, deploys, and manages modern stateless workloads. 
  - can build the applications in any language using whatever frameworks and tools
  - deploy them in seconds without manage and maintain the server infrastructure. 
    - distracts way all the infrastructure management
    - such as provisioning, configuring, managing those servers 
    - only focus on developing applications. 
  - run request or event driven stateless workloads 
    - without having to worry bout servers.  
- automatically scales up and down from zero 
  - depending upon traffic almost instantaneously
  - no worry about scale configuration. 
- pay for only the resources used 
  - calculated down to the nearest 100 milliseconds. 
  - no pay for those over provisioned resources. 
- gives the choice of running the containers
  - with fully managed or in the own GKE cluster. 
  - deploy the stateless containers with a consistent developer experience to a fully managed environment or to the own GKE cluster. 
  - This common experiences enabled by Knative 
    - Cloud Run is built on Knative
      - an open source Kubernetes based platform. 
      - an open API and runtime environment built on top of Kubernetes. 
- gives the freedom to move the workloads across different environments and platforms, 
  - either fully managed on GCP, on GKE 
  - or anywhere a Knative runs. 
- enables you to deploy stateless containers 
  - that listen for requests or events delivered via HTTP requests.
