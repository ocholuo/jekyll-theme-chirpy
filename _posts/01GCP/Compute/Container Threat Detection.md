key findings identified by Container Threat Detection:
- **Suspicious Binary Executions**
  - can see when a binary that <font color=blue> was not part of the original container image </font> is executed, and triggers a finding
  - indicating that an attacker may have control of the workload and executing suspicious software
    - such as malware or cryptocurrency mining software
- **Suspicious Library Loaded**
  - can detect when a library that <font color=blue> was not part of the original container image </font> is loaded
  - the attacker may has control of the workload and that they are executing arbitrary code.  
- **Reverse Shell**
  - monitors for processes that get started with stream redirection to a remote connected socket.
  - An attacker can use a reverse shell to communicate from a compromised workload to an attacker controlled machine and perform malicious activities
