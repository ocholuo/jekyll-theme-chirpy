# Development in the cloud

---


## development.

- Git
  - use Git to store and manage the source code trees.
  - running their own Git instances or using a hosted Git provider.
    - Running the own: have total control.
    - Using a hosted Git provider: less work.
  - Cloud Source Repositories
    - keep code private to a GCP project
    - use IAM permissions to protect it,
    - and not have to maintain the Git instance theself.  

---

### Cloud Source Repositories

- Cloud Source Repositories
  - provides Git version control
    - to support the team's development of any application or service,
    - including those that run on App Engine, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes Engine.
  - can have any number of private Git repositories
    - to organize the code associated with the cloud project in whatever way works best for you.
  - contains a source viewer
    - browse and view repository files from within the GCP console.


---



## Infrastructure as code

- Setting up the environment in GCP can entail many steps:
  - setting up compute network and storage resources,
  - and keeping track of their configurations.

- do it all by hand `imperative`
  - figure out the commands to set up the environment
  - to change the environment
    - figure out the commands to change it from the old state to the new.
  - to clone the environment,
    - do all those commands again.

---

### Deployment Manager `declarative rather than imperative`

- an Infrastructure Management Service for GCP resources.

- use a template.
  - a specification of what the environment should look like.  

- automates the creation and management of the Google Cloud Platform resources

- To use it  
  - create a template file
    - using either the YAML markup language or Python
    - describes the components of the environment  
  - give the template to Deployment Manager
    - figures out and does the actions needed to create the environment the template describes.

- to change the environment
  - edit the template and then tell Deployment Manager to update the environment to match the change.

- can store and version control the Deployment Manager templates in Cloud Source repositories.


```bash
export MY_ZONE=us-central1-f
echo $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
vim mydeploy.yaml
# resources:
# - name: my-vm
#   type: compute.va.instance
#   properties:
#     zone: ZONE
#     machineType: zones/ZONE/machineTypes/na-standard-1

#     metadata:
#      items:
#      - key: startup_script
#        value: "apt-get update"

#     disks:
#     - deviceName: boot
#     type: PERSISTENT
#     boot: true
#     autoDelete: true
#     initializeParams:
#         sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-v201709$

#     networkInterfaces:
#     - network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/global/networks/default
#     accessConfigs:
#     - name: External NAT
#         type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT

sed -i -e 's/PROJECT_ID/'$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/ mydeploy.yaml
sed -i -e 's/ZONE/'$MY_ZONE/ mydeploy.yaml

gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-dep1 \
    --config mydeploy.yaml

gcloud deployment-manager deployments list


gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-dep1 \
    --config mydeploy.yaml
```

## Proactive instrumentation: Stackdriver

![Screen Shot 2021-06-30 at 1.11.02 AM](https://i.imgur.com/9sLtQFa.png)

- Monitoring
  - lets you figure out whether the changes you made were good or bad.
  - lets you respond with information rather than with panic, when one of the end users complains that the application is down.



### Stackdriver



- GCP's tool for monitoring, logging and diagnostics (debug, error reporting, trace)
  - gives access to many different kinds of signals from the infrastructure platforms, virtual machines, containers, middleware and application tier, logs, metrics and traces.
  - gives insight into the application's health, performance and availability.

- core components of Stackdriver:
  - Monitoring, Logging, Trace, Error Reporting and Debugging.

- checks the endpoints of web applications and other Internet accessible services running on the cloud environment.
- configure uptime checks associated with URLs, groups or resources such as Instances and load balancers.
- set up alerts on interesting criteria,
  - like when health check results or uptimes fall into levels that need action.
- use Monitoring with a lot of popular notification tools.
- create dashboards to help visualize the state of the application.


### Stackdriver Logging

![Screen Shot 2021-06-30 at 1.37.17 AM](https://i.imgur.com/DjbicRa.png)

- view logs from the applications and filter and search on them.
- define metrics based on log
  - based on log contents that are incorporated into dashboards and alerts.
- export logs to BigQuery, Cloud Storage and Cloud PubSub.



### Stackdriver Error Reporting

![Screen Shot 2021-06-30 at 1.37.46 AM](https://i.imgur.com/3lwE35H.png)

- tracks and groups the errors in the cloud applications.
- notifies you when new errors are detected.


### Stackdriver Trace

![Screen Shot 2021-06-30 at 1.38.11 AM](https://i.imgur.com/gAFEdwa.png)

- sample the latency of app engine applications and report Per-URL statistics.


### Stackdriver Debugger

![Screen Shot 2021-06-30 at 1.38.53 AM](https://i.imgur.com/gFT2uFY.png)

> debugging
> go back into it and add lots of logging statements.

Stackdriver Debugger
- offers a different way.
- It connects the applications production data to the source code.
- inspect the state of the application at any code location in production.
- view the application stage without adding logging statements.

- works best when the application source code is available, such as in Cloud Source repositories.
- it can be in other repositories too.

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom | gzip -9 >> /dev/null &
