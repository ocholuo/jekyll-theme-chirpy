# CMM - Capability Maturity Model Integration

**Capability Maturity Model Integration** (**CMMI**)
- a process level improvement training and appraisal program.
- Administered by the **CMMI Institute**, Subsidiary of "ISACA"
- required by many U.S. Government contracts, especially in "Software development".
- CMMI can be used to `guide process improvement across a project, division, or an entire organization`.
- may also be used as a framework for appraising the process maturity of the organization.
- CMMI defines the following maturity levels for processes: `Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimizing`.

Originally CMMI addresses three areas of interest:
1. Product and service development – CMMI for `Development` (CMMI-DEV),
2. Service establishment, management, – CMMI for `Services` (CMMI-SVC),
3. Product and service acquisition – CMMI for `Acquisition` (CMMI-ACQ).

In version 2.0 these three areas (that previously had a separate model each) were merged into a single model.

### Representation

CMMI existed in two representations:
- continuous and staged.
- the `continuous representation` allow the user to
  - focus on the specific processes that are considered important for the organization's immediate business objectives,
  - or those to which the organization assigns a high degree of risks.
- The `staged representation`
  - provide a standard sequence of improvements,
  - can serve as a basis for comparing the maturity of different projects and organizations.
  - The staged representation also provides for an easy migration from the SW-CMM to CMMI.

CMM衍生出了一些改善模型，比如：
1. SW-CMM (Software CMM) 软件CMM
2. SE-CMM (System Engineering CMM) 系统工程CMM
3. SA-CMM (Software Acquisition CMM) 软件采购CMM
4. IPT-CMM (Integrated Product Team CMM) 集成产品群组CMM
5. P-CMM (People CMM)人力资源能力成熟度模型


`The CMMI Process Areas (PAs)` can be grouped into the following 4Each process area is defined by a set of goals and practices. There are two categories of goals and practices:

Generic goals and practices: They are part of every process area.

Specific goals and practices: They are specific to a given process area. categories to understand their interactions and links with one another regardless of their defined level:
- Process Management
- Project Management
- Engineering
- Support

Each process area is defined by a set of goals and practices.
- There are two categories of goals and practices:
- `Generic goals and practices`: They are part of every process area.
- `Specific goals and practices`: They are specific to a given process area.

### Security

To address user security concerns, two unofficial security guides are available.

* OPSD – Organizational Preparedness for Secure Development
* SMP – Secure Management in Projects
* SRTS – Security Requirements and Technical Solution
* SVV – Security Verification and Validation

While they do not affect maturity or capability levels, these process areas can be reported in appraisal results.
