# arpspoof

- Dug Song
- for inject between two systems on the network
- just choose 2 IP, It taks cares the rest of it.

- Not selecting a pair of hosts to sit between, bur sit between the entire network and the default gateway. 
  - problem: only one side of the conversation will arrive at this system-the side that is destined for the default gateway. 
  - The response from outside the network won't show up at the system where arpspoof is running. 
- This could be fixed by adding `-t with a target IP address`, `- r to indicate that reverse connections should be collected as wel`l. 
- Then, both of the systems specified would be spoofed to go to the system where arpspoof is running.
