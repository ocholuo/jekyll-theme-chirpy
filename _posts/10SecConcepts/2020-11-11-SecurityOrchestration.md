# Security Orchestration

## Security Orchestration

- integrate a disparate ecosystem of SOC tools into a unified ecosystem
  - dozens of cybersecurity security tools in place to prevent, detect and remediate threats.
  - the results are inefficiencies, heightened security risks and lower employee morale.
  - creating harmony between processes and technologies, so SOC tasks can be completed in a single console.
- automate tasks for simpler, more effective security operations.

## Security Orchestration vs Security Automation
- closely related terms
- the differences between them.
  - Security orchestration: `integrates and streamlines cybersecurity processes and tools into a unified whole` in order to streamline a range of security operations tasks.
  - Security automation: `accomplishes many of these tasks with machines`, free up human resources for other priorities.
- security automation is one component of a **comprehensive security orchestration strategy**.


## Security Orchestration Empowers Your SOC
- Security orchestration enables security operations teams to realize their full potential and get more from their existing staff and technologies.
- Siemplify security orchestration is built on six pillars to
  - help teams make more informed decisions,
  - formalize workflows
  - and automate incident response actions
  - all while getting the most out of their existing security tools.

Security orchestration provides:

1. **Contextualize and centralize incident response data**
   - Security orchestration sees through the noise and provides analysts with context-rich data for deeper analysis in one central location.
   - By integrating your SOC ecosystem, transform rows of textual data into meaningful, context-rich detail.
   - Security operations teams now have the information they need at their fingertips, reducing the amount of time spent gathering data and increasing the time spent on analysis, response and remediation activities, and high-quality investigations.

2. **Security Orchestration Reduces Analyst Caseload**
   - `Security Orchestration` reduces analyst caseload, focus on solving cases rather than managing alerts.
   - Siemplify automatically groups related alerts into manageable, workable cases, saving analysts time on alert triage and allowing for more focused case analysis.
   - `Alert grouping`
     - all the associated details needed to investigate and respond are grouped within a single case,
     - allows a SOC to quickly analyze, triage and remediate across all entities that share common attributes.
     - allowing for more focused analysis.
     - And this case management approach reduces workload, freeing up analysts to handle more cases in less time.


3. **Easily investigate a cyberthreat through visual mapping**
   - provides an interactive way for cyberthreat.
   - Siemplify integrates data across a security operations ecosystem and `creates a robust visual threat storyline`,
   - allowing analysts to see the different components and relationships involved in a security event.


4. **Automate & streamline incident response tasks**
    - accelerates incident response time, easy to codify security operations.
    - SOC teams can quickly build, run and automate playbooks for consistent and rapid incident response time.  optimize analyst time.


5. **Collaborate & communicate to improve performance**
    - creates SOC cohesiveness by improving team collaboration and communication.
    - Siemplify serves as a workbench for all security operations activities, facilitating real-time communication and collaboration through integrated chat, automated case assignments and escalations and a cross-functional war room.


6. **Drive efficient SecOps management and continuous improvement**
    - Siemplify provides comprehensive reporting and business intelligence capabilities, eliminating the need for manually-produced reliable metrics.
    - clear view of current cases and response times, allowing SOC teams to identify ways to improve productivity and effectiveness.

7. **Security Orchestration Delivers Measurable ROI**
    - tool overload, making the business case to add yet another detection or prevention technology is fuzzy at best.
    - make existing processes more efficient, and therefore have an ROI that is easy to quantify and calculate.
    - can save security operations organizations hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars annually through increased efficiency and better resource allocation.
    - Enterprises generally see these savings spread across four key areas:
      - alert handling costs,
      - reporting costs,
      - analyst training costs
      - and miscellaneous operational costs.
