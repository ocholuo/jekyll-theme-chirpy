### Review Old, Backup and Unreferenced Files for Sensitive Information (OTG-CONFIG-004) Enumerate Infrastructure and Application Admin Interfaces (OTG-CONFIG-005)

### Test `HTTP Methods` (OTG-CONFIG-006)

```bash
1. Discover the Supported Method
   # - The OPTIONS HTTP method provides the tester with the most direct and effective way to do that.
   # RFC 2616 states that, “The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identi- fied by the Request-URI”.

    $ nc www.victim.com 80 OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.victim.com
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0
    Date: Tue, 31 Oct 2006 08:00:29 GMT Connection: close
    Allow: GET, HEAD, POST, TRACE, OPTIONS Content-Length: 0
    # OPTIONS provides a list of the methods that are supported by the web server
    # see that TRACE method is enabled. The danger that is posed by this method is illustrated in the following section

2. Test XST Potential
   # - the most recurring attack patterns in Cross Site Scripting is to access the document.cookie object and send it to a web server controlled by the attacker
   # - so that he or she can hijack the victim’s session.
   # - Tagging a cookie as httpOnly forbids JavaScript from accessing it, protecting it from being sent to a third party.
   # - However, the TRACE method can be used to bypass this protection and access the cookie even in this scenario.

    $ nc www.victim.com 80 TRACE / HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.victim.com
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0
    Date: Tue, 31 Oct 2006 08:01:48 GMT Connection: close
    Content-Type: message/http Content-Length: 39
    TRACE / HTTP/1.1 Host: www.victim.com

   # - If the tester instructs a browser to issue a TRACE request to the web server, and this browser has a cookie for that domain, the cookie will be automatically included in the request headers, and will therefore be echoed back in the resulting response.
   # - At that point, the cookie string will be accessible by JavaScript and it will be finally possible to send it to a third party even when the cookie is tagged as httpOnly.

   # to make a browser issue a TRACE request:
   # - XMLHTTP ActiveX control in Internet Explorer
   # - XM- LDOM in Mozilla and Netscape.
   # - However, for security reasons the browser is allowed to start a connection only to the domain where the hostile script resides. This is a mitigating factor, as the attacker needs to combine the TRACE method with another vulnerability in order to mount the attack.

    # An attacker has two ways to successfully launch a Cross Site Trac- ing attack:
    # • Leveraging another server-side vulnerability: the attacker injects the hostile JavaScript snippet that contains the TRACE request in the vulnerable application, as in a normal Cross Site Scripting attack
    # • Leveraging a client-side vulnerability: the attacker creates a malicious website that contains the hostile JavaScript snippet and exploits some cross-domain vulnerability of the browser of the victim, in order to make the JavaScript code successfully perform a connection to the site that supports the TRACE method and that originated the cookie that the attacker is trying to steal.
```


### Test `HSTS HTTP Strict Transport Security` (OTG-CONFIG-007)

- The `HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header`
- a mechanism that web sites have to communicate to the web browsers that all traffic exchanged with a given domain must always be sent over https
  - protect the information from being passed over unencrypted requests.
  - ensure that all the data travels encrypted from the web browser to the server.
  - The `HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)` feature lets a web application to inform the browser, through the use of a special response header, that it should never establish a connection to the the specified domain servers using HTTP. Instead it should automatically establish all connection requests to access the site through HTTPS.

The HTTP strict transport security header uses two directives:
- `-max-age`:
  - the number of seconds that the browser should automatically convert all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- `includeSubDomains`:
  - all web application’s sub-domains must use HTTPS.
  - If this parameter is set, then the HSTS policy applies to the visited domain and all the subdomains as well.
  - If not it only applies to the exact domain that the user has visited.

This header by web applications must be checked:
- `Attackers sniffing the network traffic` and accessing the information transferred through an unencrypted channel.
- `Attackers exploiting a man in the middle attack` because of the problem of accepting certificates that are not trusted.
- Users who `mistakenly entered an address` in the browser putting HTTP instead of HTTPS, or users who click on a link in a web application which mistakenly indicated the http protocol.
- user `clicks on HTTP links` or even if the user type an HTTP link.
- HSTS policy `prevents an user from accepting self-signed or abnormally signed certificates`, since remember the certification authority (CA) that signed the previous seen certificate.


```bash
$ curl --silent --head https://us.shein.com/ | grep -i strict
strict-transport-security: max-age=7776000000;
includeSubDomains
