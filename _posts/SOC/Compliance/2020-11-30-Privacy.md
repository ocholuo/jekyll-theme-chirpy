## SOC 2 Privacy

- In a **SOC 2 privacy** audit, the criteria apply to `personal data, notably personally identifiable information (PII)` (such as health records, social security numbers, addresses, credit card information, etc...)
- The **SOC 2 privacy** criteria is applicable when the **service organization** `interacts directly with the data subject`, or `collects, transmits, uses, or stores personal data`.

- A SOC 2 examination that incorporates the trust services privacy criteria will include the `processes and controls` that the service organization has in place to meet their `privacy commitments and system requirements` to its user entities.

- The privacy criteria are comprised of eight categories that make up its requirements. 
  - It encompasses the service organization’s privacy notice and the choices the data subject has over `the use and disclosure of their personal information`. 
  - It also addresses the individual’s right to access their personal information for review and update, as well as incorporating the service organization’s mechanisms in place to track and resolve inquiries, complaints, and disputes.



SOC 2 uses the `AICPA Trust Services Criteria (TSC) for Privacy`. 
- These were formerly known as the `Generally Accepted Privacy Principles(GAPP) by AICPA`. 
- With, approximately 50 points of focus, the TSC organizes the privacy criteria as:
  - `Notice and communication of objectives` — The entity provides notice to data subjects about its objectives related to privacy.
  - `Choice and consent` — The entity communicates choices available regarding the collection, use, retention, disclosure and disposal of personal information to data subjects.
  - `Collection` - The entity collects personal information to meet its objectives related to privacy.
  - `Use, retention and disposal` — The entity limits the use, retention and disposal of personal information to meet its objectives related to privacy.
  - `Access` — The entity provides data subjects with access to their personal information for review and correction (including updates) to meet its objectives related to privacy.
  - `Disclosure and notification` — The entity discloses personal information, with the consent of the data subjects, to meet its objectives related to privacy. Notification of breaches and incidents is provided to affected data subjects, regulators and others to meet its objectives related to privacy.
  - `Quality` — The entity collects and maintains accurate, up-to-date, complete and relevant personal information to meet its objectives related to privacy.
  - `Monitoring and enforcement` — The entity monitors compliance to meet its objectives related to privacy, including procedures to address privacy-related inquiries, complaints and disputes.
A
side from the Trust Services Criteria Privacy Controls, any specific privacy mandates can also be covered.

SOC 2 Type 2 for Privacy Benefits
- SOC 2 Type 2 can cover the entire year and the effectiveness of the controls in place.
- It is a Third-Party Period- of-Time assessment and so has Accountability.
- Most other assurance programs or audits are only, at a point in time.
- Since it is a period assessment, it is more like a continuous compliance with low risk and high reliability. It also provides assurance on operative effectiveness of controls
- Comprehensive Framework for Privacy by AICPA.
- Provides a high reliability SOC 2 Seal by AICPA.
- SOC 2 Provides better visibility with detailed controls in the report in contrast to ISO 27001, ISO 27701 standard that provides just a certificate.

## SOC 2 Privacy & GDPR Differences

Examples of **SOC 2 Privacy** and **GDPR** Differences

  - **SOC 2 Privacy** criteria is `not legally enforceable and is primarily recognized in the United States`.


- right to be forgotten
  - **GDPR**
    - the concept of the data subject’s “right to be forgotten” was introduced, subject to interpretation. 
    - If the data subject revokes their consent to the organization to process their data and requests the organization to erase and stop distributing their personal data, the organization must comply and purge the data. 
    - This extends to the organization’s third parties to whom information was disclosed and requires the organization to `take appropriate steps to notify such third parties to erase` the subject’s personal data from their systems.

- Sanctions and/or fines
  - **SOC 2 Privacy** criteria 
    - an elective assessment, `non-compliance may lead to a qualified report and loss of trust` by user entities and other readers of the report. 
  - **GDPR** 
    - the roles and responsibilities of the data controllers and data processors are defined, and they may be held liable for failing to properly secure personal data and for failure to comply with the regulations. 
    - `Sanctions and/or fines may be imposed upon any non-compliant` organization inside or outside the EU up to $20 million EUR or 4% of the annual global turnover whichever is greater.


- Data Protection Officer
  - **GDPR**: 
    - Large organizations that perform significant processing of personal data may require a Data Protection Officer. 
    - This individual’s role and responsibility would be to advise the organization about compliance with **GDPR** rules. 
  - **SOC 2 Privacy** criteria: This is not a requirement


- consider privacy guidelines in the projects 
  - **GDPR**: an organization must consider privacy guidelines and best practices at the onset of projects that may impact personal information held or processed. The GDPR’s privacy-by-design standard ensures that privacy is at the forefront rather than an afterthought.
  - **SOC 2 Privacy** criteria: This is not called out



> The **GDPR** is far reaching and very detailed regarding the specific practices organizations need to have in place to ensure compliance. 
> Being in compliance with the **SOC 2 Privacy** criteria may get an organization much of the way toward compliance with GDPR.
