1. virus: a piece of malicious code that spreads from one computer to another by attaching itself to other files using self replication. Note that they'd require human interaction to self replicate. Do to its self replicating nature, they are quite difficult to remove from a system. They also use tactics to hide on the system, like polymorphic code which encrypts and duplicates itself which makes it a little bit harder for the antivirus to find. This is known as a polymorphic virus. Other category of a Malware virus which threatens to shield itself by obscuring the true location in the system. And its code make it harder to reverse engineer to create signatures for it.
2. Worms： self-replicating Malware that does not require human interaction. main goal is spread and cripple resources or turn computers into zombies.
3. Trojans: hiden Malware that causes damage to a system or gives an attack access to the host. They are usually introducted into the environment to a computer by posing as a vending package, such as a game, wallpaper, or any kind of download.
4. Spyware, the main goal of spyware is to track and report the usage of the host or to collect data that the attacker desires to obtain. It can include web browsing history, personal information, marketing information, any kind of files the attacker wants to chase.
5. Adware, code that automatically displays or downloads unsolicited advertisements, usually seen on a browser pop up.
6. RATs remote access tool/trojans. allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access and control the computer.
7. rootkit: piece of software that is intended to take full or partial control of a system at the lowest level. Now we have Ransomeware.
