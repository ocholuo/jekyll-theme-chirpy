# Web Application Testing: Step by Step Process to make it Right



![WebTesting-Overview](https://i.imgur.com/HYDtyOB.jpg)



---


## **Step 1: Functionality Testing**

- make sure that the web application is functionally correct.
- Functionality testing checks the `database connection, all links in the web pages, cookies, forms used for submitting and/or getting info from the user` etc.

Once you get the results of those tasks, you simply compare them with the expected output. It has to be done multiple times with different data input. If the level of accuracy is the same every time, the app is considered functionally correct.

Check out all the **links**:
- Test the outgoing links from all the pages to the specific domain under test.
- `Internal Links`: Test all internal links.
- Test links jumping on the same page.
- `email link`: Test links are used to send emails to admin or other users from web pages.
- Test to see if there are any orphan pages.
- `External Links`: check for broken links in all the above-mentioned links.

Test **forms** on all pages:
- Forms are an integral part of any website.
- Forms are used for receiving information from users and to interact with them
- `Field validation`: check `all the validations on each field`.
- Check for `default values in the fields`.
- `Error message for wrong input`: Wrong inputs in the forms to the fields in the forms.
- Optional and Mandatory fields
- `Options` to create forms, form delete, view or modify the forms.


**Cookie** Testing:
- Cookies are small files stored on the user machine, used to maintain the session – mainly the login sessions.
- Test the application by `enabling or disabling the cookies in your browser options`.
- Test if the cookies are `encrypted` before writing to the user machine.
- If you are testing session cookies (i.e. cookies that expire after the session ends) check for login sessions and user stats after the session ends.
- Check the effect on application security by deleting the cookies.


Validate your **HTML/CSS**:
- optimizing your site for Search engines, HTML/CSS validation is the most important one.
- Mainly validate the site for HTML syntax errors.
- Check if the site is crawlable to different search engines.


**Database** Testing:
- Check for data integrity and errors while you edit, delete, modify the forms or do any DB related functionality.
- Check if all the database queries are executed correctly, data is retrieved and also updated correctly.



---

## **Step 2: Usability Testing**

- combines the previously mentioned functionality testing with the overall user experience.
- Usability testing can be done by getting external testers that simulate your expected user base, or internally by the developers themselves. If you want to perform external testing but don’t know where to find suitable testers, apps like Apple’s TestFlight might help you.


Usability testing can be broken down to 4 stages:

* Developing the testing strategy in a way that `all functions of the app are examined including the navigation and content`
* Recruiting the internal or external test participants
* `Running the test with the team of experts`
* `Analyzing results and improving your app accordingly`



Usability Testing includes the following:
- `Ease of learning`: The website should be easy to use.
- Navigation
- Subjective user satisfaction
- General appearance


**Ease of learning**
- The website should be easy to use.
- The instructions provided should be very clear.
- Check if the instructions provided are perfect to satisfy its purpose.
- The main menu should be provided on each page.
- It should be consistent enough.


Test for **Navigation**:
- how a user surfs the web pages,
- different controls like buttons, boxes or how the user uses the links on the pages to surf different pages.


**Content** Checking:
- Content should be logical and easy to understand. Check for spelling errors. The usage of dark colors annoys the users and should not be used in the site theme.
- follow some standard colors that are used for web pages and content building. commonly accepted standards
- Content should be meaningful. All the anchor text links should be working properly.
- Images should be placed properly with proper sizes.
- validate everything for UI testing.
- Check for all links on the sitemap.


---


## **Step 3: Interface Testing**

- checks the communication process,
  - whether all interaction between the app server and the web server run smoothly.
- the displaying of error messages are handled properly.
- whether the interruptions by the server and/or by the user are handled properly.
  - Check what happens if the user interrupts any transaction in-between
- what happens if the connection to the webserver is reset in between?



The main interfaces are:
- Web server and application server interface
- Application server and Database server interface.


---


## **Step 4: Compatibility Testing**


includes the following:
- `Browser compatibility`:
  - Some applications are very dependent on browsers.
  - Different browsers have different configurations and settings that your web page should be compatible with.
  - website coding should be a `cross-browser platform compatible`.
  - If you are using java scripts or AJAX calls for UI functionality, performing security checks or validations then give more stress on browser compatibility testing of your web application.
  - Test web applications on different browsers like `Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape Navigator, AOL, Safari, Opera browsers with different versions`.


- `Operating system compatibility`:
  - All new technologies used in web development like graphic designs and interface calls like different API’s may not be available in all Operating Systems.
  - Different operating systems display certain app elements differently. This is why it is important to run the compatibility tests with as many operating systems as possible
  - test on different operating systems like `Windows, Unix, MAC, Linux, Solaris` with different OS flavors.

- `Mobile browsing`:
  - mobile browser compatibility, confirm the app displays correctly across mobile browsers.
  - for portable devices, ensure the web app `displays as it should on all device types`.

- `Printing options`:
  - page-printing options then make sure fonts, page alignment, page graphics, etc., are getting printed properly.
  - Pages should fit the paper size or as per the size mentioned in the printing option.





---

## **Step 5: Performance Testing**

Performance testing can be applied to understand the web site’s scalability or to benchmark the performance in the environment of third-party products such as servers and middleware for potential purchase.


- `Web Load Testing`:
  - check performance under a heavy load,
  - testing under different internet speeds as well as under normal and peak loads.
  - might be a good idea to test your overall web server performance on a basic level, through a website speed automated test, as page speed influences user experience a lot, and affects your public website’s SEO.
  - if many users are accessing or requesting the same page. Can the system sustain peak load time?
  - The site should handle many `simultaneous user requests, large input data from users, simultaneous connection to DB, heavy load on specific pages, etc`.

- `Web Stress testing`
  - to `determine the breaking point of the app`;
  - it involves putting the app under increasing amounts of stress until it stops functioning.
  - stretching the system beyond its `specified limits`.
  - break the site by giving stress and it’s checked as to `how the system reacts to stress` and `how it recovers from crashes`.
  - Stress is generally given on `input fields, login and sign up areas`.
  - discover your app’s breaking point before the users do.

In web performance, testing website functionality on different operating systems and different hardware platforms is checked for software and hardware memory leakage errors.

Connection **Speed**
Tested on various networks like Dial-Up, ISDN, etc.

**Load**
- What is the no. of users per time?
- Check for peak loads and how the system behaves
- A large amount of data accessed by the user

**Stress**
- Continuous Load
- Performance of memory, CPU, file handling, etc..

## **Step 6: Security Testing**

the basic steps of security testing:

* Understanding the security goals and planning the test by considering the security needs of each of them
* Identifying the app’s security needs
* Gathering the info about the elements used to develop the app including the OS, hardware, technology etc.
* `Identifying and listing all potential threats and vulnerabilities`
* Preparing the `threat profile` based on the listed vulnerabilities and risks
* Preparing the `test plan`
* `Automated testing` on top of the manual testing
* Preparing the `Security tests case document`
* Carrying out the `Security test cases execution, fixing identified defects, retesting`
* Creating a `detailed report on the security testing`, including the solved issues and the risks that still persist


The following are some of the test cases for web security testing:
- Test by `pasting the internal URL` directly into the browser address bar without login. Internal pages should not open.
- If you are logged in using username and password and browsing internal pages, then try changing URL options directly. I.e. If you are checking some publisher site statistics with publisher site ID= 123. Try `directly changing the URL site ID parameter to a different site ID which is not related to the logged-in user`. Access should be denied for this user to view other people’s stats.
- `Try invalid inputs` in input fields like login username, password, input text boxes, etc. Check the system’s reaction to all invalid inputs.
- `Web directories and files should not be accessible directly` unless they are given the download option.
- Test the `CAPTCHA` to automate script logins.
- Test if `SSL is used for security measures`. If used, the proper message should get displayed when users switch from non-secure HTTP:// pages to secure HTTPS:// pages and vice versa.
- All `transactions, error messages, and security breach attempts should be logged in log files` somewhere on the webserver.


The primary reason for testing the security of a web is to identify potential vulnerabilities and subsequently repair them.
- Network Scanning
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Password Cracking
- Log Review
- Integrity Checkers
- Virus Detection


- Check for major security flaws associated with user authentication:
  - Does logging in involve a two-step verification?
  - After you’ve logged out, can you access your account (or any pages with sensitive data) without logging in?
  - Are there password rules in place an all authentication pages (sign up/registration, sign in, change password, forgot password, etc)?
  - Does the password field mask user input?
  - After changed the password, can you still log in account with an old password?
  - How many times can the user input an invalid password?
  - Does the app lock the user out in case they have exceeded the number of attempts for entering the password?

- Does sensitive data appear in any of the following:
  - URL.
  - `Error messages` of any sort.
  - Any pages that don’t require a login.
  - In the `source code` of the page. If yes, is the View Page Source / View Source Code option disabled?
  - Is there any sensitive data stored in `cookies`?
  - Is sensitive data of any kind still accessible if some functionality of the app is not working?
  - Are there traceable log files for storing important information? Does the app update these files as specified?

- Does the app use HTTPS / SSL?
  - Does the app use encryption when handling sensitive data (including user credentials, bio, card information, etc)?
  - If there are session values in the address bar, does the app encrypt these values?
  - Does the app encrypt cookie data?

- What happens if you refresh the page or click/tap Back when an transferring sensitive data (e.g. credentials, payment info, etc.) is mid-progress?
- Can the user use your app after the session has expired?
- Can a user access the functionality that is only available to other roles (e.g. can a regular user access admin-only features)?
- How does the app handle an SQL injection?

## Types of Web Testing
A website is classified into many types, about 20 types.
- All these are shrinking under static and dynamic type.
- Among them let’s discuss 4 types and their testing methods in a detailed manner.




---


#### Simple static website testing

A simple static website will display the same content for all visitors who are visiting the website at different times. It is also known as an informational website.
- On a static website, only developers can make changes that too in code only.
- This type of website will not have any major functionalities and it purely depends on UI design.


1. Testing the GUI design, because static website purely depends on it.
   - compare the approved PSD files with the web page developed.
   - Check all the elements in the design should be presented on the developed page.
   - check the font size, font style, spacing, and color everything has been reproduced.
   - Check the scroll bar carefully


2. check the links whether it is working properly or not.
   - broken link?


3. Verify the spelling and content in all web pages by comparing the content given by the client.


4. Check if the image will not display properly, it may break or sometimes the image gets duplicated, wrong images may display.


5. check contact form:
   - if it is working properly by sending some dummy messages.
   - Is the message being sent properly and a successful message appearing?
   - correct email receiver to the concerned person
   - Check email should not land in spam as junk mail?
   - If there is a reply email trigger is activated then check whether the sender received the mail?


6. Check whether it is an error-free web page and validate it with W3 validator or other related software.


7. Some constant things to be checked in a static website,
   - Check favicon is present on the tab bar
   - URL should contain the correct page title
   - displayed copyright
   - If there is a contact form, Captcha is a must. [to prevents junk email]
   - Check the loading speed of the website. [A static website should not take much time for loading]. If a gif image is used while loading then track its functionality


Apart from these, there are huge things that have to be tested at the backend of every website that is `system testing, security testing, interface testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing`, etc.


---


#### Dynamic web application testing

It is the type where the user can update and change their website content regularly.
- The web application is a combination of front-end and back-end programming.
  - The front-end will be HTML and CSS
  - back-end uses programming languages like PHP, Javascript, and ASP etc.
  - With this backend, user/client can add or change the content on the website.


There are 2 types of web applications:
- `no action will be carried out by the user in front-end `(i.e. only back-end changes will reflect in front-end)
- `end-user will work in front-end itself` (for example login, signup, newsletter subscription, and other similar actions).


Points to Remember, the following things are to be noted.

1. In GUI section,
   - tooltip is compulsory for all fields and buttons,
   - field alignment (spacing) should be done properly,
   - disabled field/ buttons should be greyed out,
   - fields/ buttons should be in standard format as in SRS,
   - error message should be displayed if something goes wrong,
   - pop-up message should only display at the center of the web page,
   - drop-down menu should not be truncated.
   - Tab shortcut key should work in all fields and more.

2. In functionality section,
   - if web application is having login or sign up functionality, then check the
   - `mandatory field validation`,
   - `form validation` (i.e. number fields should accept only numbers, not alphabets ),
   - `character restriction on fields` (i.e. only these many characters can be entered).
   - Special characters and negative numbers restriction on fields,
   - testing the email functionality,
   - testing the document upload (i.e. only specified document type can be uploaded),
   - timeout functionality,
   - sorting functionality,
   - javascript is working on compatible browsers etc should be tested.

3. When coming to back-end functionality section,
   - test image uploading for broken images,
   - text entering in the fields is working or not.
   - Back-end update should reflect on front-end, database testing (i.e. whether you can add new fields or deleting unwanted fields) all these things are to be performed.

#### E-commerce website testing

An e-commerce website is somewhat complicated when compared to the above two.
- The tester needs to be very cautious while testing an e-commerce site.


1. In the GUI section
   - check all the features as in SRS and the same with the functionality.
   - The functionality will be almost the same for all commercial websites.

2. Functionality
   - check all pages such as the `main page` (includes featured products, special offers display, log in details, search functionality) `product detail page`, `category page`, `placing an order`, `payment gateway` everything has to be tested.


Points to Remember:

1. Check if the `shopping cart is getting updated` when you buy or increase the quantity. Check this functionality in all the pages and circumstances.

2. Check if `special coupons` and offers are applied to correct orders and you see the discounted price is displaying or not.

3. Sometimes while updating a single product it will get multiplied by considering the number of variations in the product. So check whether the single product is displayed and its variations are displayed correctly. (I faced this problem)

4. Check if the `filter option` whether is working exactly. If filtering is been done, based on the category & pricing chosen?

5. While sign up, `super validation` should be done. Only the new user can sign up.

6. If an existing user, added a product to the shopping basket, the wishlist section during their previous login should be saved and displayed during the next login too.

7. Compare products should work by comparing the products based on some specifications assigned in the back-end.

8. Check whether the `Currency converter` is working fine. Based on the country chosen the currency converter should display the relevant price and tax rates. On choosing the language Currency will be converted, here USD is meant to be default

9. Generally many Plug-ins are used in an e-commerce (WordPress & similar) website. The plug-in installation may conflict or affect any other major functionality. follow up with the plug-ins installation and its usage.

10. Check whether the social sharing option is working on the individual product or not.

11. Shipping cost should be generated based on the region selected. And also check the tax rate generation.

12. `Payment gateway` should work only if valid card details are given. Validation should apply to the Card number and CCV code number.

13. `Email generation` on each and every process during purchase should happen (sign up, product ordering, payment successful, order canceled, order received and other email triggers if any).

14. Check the live chat with some dumpy emails.

#### Mobile website testing

Points to Remember, to consider while testing a mobile website:

- use an emulator for testing a mobile website
- GUI & usability testing are more important as it is not the reflection of the desktop version.
- Performance is another important factor to be considered for mobile website testing. Performance-related issues can be tracked when you test in the real devices.
- Check whether browsing normal web links from mobile is getting triggered by a mobile link.
- Check page scrolling, page navigation, text truncation, etc on the mobile website.
