## Required Ports and FQDNs Required for Cortex Data Lake

If using a <kbd>Palo Alto Networks firewall</kbd> to secure traffic between Panorama, the firewalls, and Cortex Data Lake,
- use the <kbd>App-ID</kbd> `paloalto-logging-service` in a Security policy rule to
  - **allow Panorama and the firewalls to connect to Cortex Data Lake**
  - and **forward logs on TCP 444 and 3978** (default ports for the application)
- If firewall has an Applications and Threats content version earlier than 8290, must also allow the panorama app-id in a security policy rule.

If using <kbd>another vendor’s firewall</kbd>
- use the following table to identify the `fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) and ports` that must allow traffic to ensure that `Panorama` and the `firewalls` can successfully connect to `Cortex Data Lake`.

## Cortex Data Lake Log Sources

Here are the products and services that can send logs to Cortex Data Lake:

sources | log type | Note
---|---|---
**Palo Alto Networks Firewalls** [link](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/product-selection) | firewalls log | onboard individual firewalls directly to Cortex Data Lake. Use the `Explore app` to view all log records that the firewalls forward to Cortex Data Lake.
**Panorama-Managed Firewalls** [link](https://www.paloguard.com/Panorama.asp)| firewalls log | onboard firewalls to Cortex Data Lake at scale, instead of onboarding each individual firewall. All Cortex Data Lake logs are visible directly in Panorama. 
**Prisma Access** | the logs, ACC, and reports from Panorama for remote network and mobile user traffic | Prisma Access deploys and manages the security infrastructure globally to secure remote networks and mobile users. Prisma Access logs directly to Cortex Data Lake. <br> - To enable logging for Prisma Access, must purchase a Cortex Data Lake license. <br> - Log traffic does not use the licensed bandwidth purchased for Prisma Access.
**Cortex XDR** | Cortex XDR alerts are automatically written to Cortex Data Lake as log records | other apps can read and respond to alerts. <br> - These log records are not visible in `Explore`; <br> - can use `Log Forwarding app` to forward XDR alerts to the email or Syslog destination and configure email alert notifications within XDR.

## Cortex Data Lake License activation

Cortex Data Lake collects log data from `next-generation firewalls, Prisma Access, and Cortex XDR`.
- When purchase Cortex Data Lake, all firewalls registered to support account receive a Cortex Data Lake license.
- also receive an auth code to activate Cortex Data Lake instance.

activation
- Use the hub to activate Cortex Data Lake.
- Use the hub to activate Cortex XDR.
  - To activate the Cortex XDR app, you must be assigned a required role and locate activation email containing a link to begin activation in the hub.
  - Activating Cortex XDR automatically includes activation of Cortex Data Lake.
    1. Begin activation.
    2. Provide details about the Cortex XDR app to activate
    3. Review the end user license agreement and Agree & Activate.
    4. Manage Apps > current status of apps.
    5. log in to Cortex XDR app to confirm access for the Cortex XDR app interface.
    6. [Allocate Log Storage for Cortex XDR](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr/cortex-xdr-pro-admin/get-started-with-cortex-xdr-pro/allocate-log-storage-for-cortex-xdr.html)
       1. [Allocate Storage Based on Log Type](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-data-lake/cortex-data-lake-getting-started/get-started-with-cortex-data-lake/set-log-storage-quota)
       2. storage allocation for Cortex Data Lake and adjust the quota as needed.
          1. Select Cortex Data Lake instance.
          2. Select Configuration > logging storage settings.
          3. The Cortex Data Lake depicts storage allocation graphically. As you adjust storage allocation, the graphic updates to display the changes to storage policy.
          4. The **Cortex Data Lake storage policy** specifies the distribution of total storage allocated to each app or service and the minimum retention warning (not supported with Cortex XDR).
          5. Allocate quota for <kbd>Cortex XDR</kbd>:
             - If purchased quota for **firewall logs**, allocate quota to the Firewall log type.
             - To use the same Cortex Data Lake instance for **both firewall logs and Cortex XDR logs**, ust first associate Panorama with the Cortex Data Lake instance before you allocate quota for firewall logs.
             - Review storage allocation for Cortex XDR according to the formula:
             - 1TB for every 200 Cortex XDR Pro endpoints for 30 days
             - By default,
             - `80% available storage is assigned to logs and data`,
             - and `20% is assigned to alerts`.
             - It is recommended to review the status of Cortex Data Lake instance after about two weeks of data collection and make adjustments as needed but to use the default allocations as a starting point.
             - Apply changes.
             - Monitor data retention.
             - From Cortex XDR > Cortex XDR License > Endpoint XDR Data Retention:
             - Current number of days your data has been stored in `Cortex XDR Data Lake`.
             - The count begins the as soon as you activate Cortex XDR.
             - Number of retention days permitted according to the quota you allocated.
       3. You must be an assigned an `Instance Administrator or higher role` to for Cortex Data Lake to manage logging storage.
