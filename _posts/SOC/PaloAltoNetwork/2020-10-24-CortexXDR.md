## Cortex XDR: Managed Threat Hunting

Managed Threat Hunting Overview

The Cortex XDR Managed Threat Hunting service is designed to find new, unnoticed threats before they pose risk to network.

Proactive Threat Hunting: Problems and Solutions
- Proactive threat hunting is difficult to conduct due to `lack of time, lack of resources, and missed attacks`.
- Cortex XDR addresses these issues through its <kbd>Managed Threat Hunting</kbd> service.


Problems
- Most teams don’t have the time to proactively hunt for threats.
- Teams rarely have advanced `threat hunters` dedicated to finding attacks.
  - Finding stealthy attacks requires vast amounts of data and threat intelligence that must be available at cloud scale.
  - Threat hunting is a data science problem that requires a unique combination of analytics expertise with a deep understanding of how adversaries work.
  - Without manual threat hunting, organizations may not find the stealthiest attacks.


Solutions > managed theat hunting
- can augment team with around-the-clock threat hunting,
- and cut dwell times and reduce risk without hiring more staff.  
- enables to find all attacks with dedicated hunting across endpoint, network, cloud, and third-party data collected by Cortex XDR.  
- can get detailed reports with context, intelligence, and guidance.

Reducing Risk with Managed Threat Hunting Reports
- Cortex XDR enables to get detailed reports based on thorough investigations of threats in organization.
- Cortex XDR provides both <kbd>threat reports</kbd> and <kbd>impact reports</kbd>.

**Threat Reports**
- The Cortex XDR Managed Threat Hunting service provides threat reports that include `technical details` of the attack, `guidance`, and `information` about additional resources.
  - Technical Details
    - the scope of the attack, the probable source, and the tools and techniques used in the attack.
  - Guidance
    - guidance on remedial steps take.
  - Additional Resources
    - links to additional resources use for investigation.  

Impact Reports
- summary information about a threat and its impact for organization.
- The report also provides information on ways to get assistance.
  - Threat
    - provide information about emerging attack campaigns, malware, and vulnerabilities.  
  - Summary
    - summary on a reported attack.
    - The summary gives details about the nature and the scope of the reported attack.  
  - Impact
    - information on whether organization was affected by the attack.
  - Assistance
    - getting assistance from Unit 42 analysts.

## Managed Threat Hunting Techniques

The Cortex XDR platform enables to conduct both manual and semi-automated threat hunting.

<kbd>Manual Hunting</kbd>
- gathers information from a variety of data sources.
- uses the data for initial investigation followed by deep investigation, and then writes a report.

> - Data Sources
> collects data from network, endpoint, cloud, and third-party sources provided by customers.
> - Idea
> Based on findings from cases or a published exploit or attack, designs a query to search for the attack.
> - Hypothesis
> validates the hypothesis, checks results, and refines the hypothesis until discovered threats or is confident that no threat exists.
> - Investigation
> conducts deeper investigation of the findings and evidence.
> - Report
> sends a report with findings to the customer.


![Screen Shot 2020-10-28 at 00.48.20](https://i.imgur.com/BaVVQ9I.png)


<kbd>Semi-Automated Hunting</kbd>
- Like manual hunting, semi-automated hunting involves collecting data from a variety of sources.
- The data is analyzed, enriched, and prioritized.
- Then the hunter uses the data for initial investigation followed by deep investigation, and writes a report.

> - Data Sources
> Data is collected from network, endpoint, cloud, and third-party sources provided by customers.
> - Signals
> Smart signals analyze all collected data to discover threats. Signals are based on one or all customers.
> - Enrichment and Prioritization
> Cortex XDR enriches the data that is analyzed by the signals and prioritizes the incident.
> - Initial Investigation
> As a first step, the hunter validates the signal before investigating it in the Cortex XDR management console.
> - Deep Investigation
> The hunter performs a manual investigation to confirm the threat and to understand the full scope of the attack.
> Report
> sends a report with findings to the customer.
