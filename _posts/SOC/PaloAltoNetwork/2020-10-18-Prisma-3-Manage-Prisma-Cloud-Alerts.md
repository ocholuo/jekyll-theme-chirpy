#  Manage Prisma Cloud Alerts

---

## Core Concepts

Prisma Cloud Core Concepts
- 4 main Prisma Cloud concepts:
  - resource, policy, alert rule, and alert.

- `resource`
  - an entity in public cloud environment.
  - may be any virtual asset or system user.
    - (for compute instances: the instance, network card, disk attached, security group attached, snapshots, and image)
  - Cloud resources are acquired by Prisma Cloud after onboard the public cloud accounts.
- `policy`
  - a statement of acceptable state or behavior.
  - A policy has a type, which indicates the underlying mechanism used to apply the policy.
  - 4 types of policies:
    - config,
    - audit event,
    - network,
    - anomaly.
- `alert rule`
  - a collection of one or more `account groups` and one or more `policies` that make up the **acceptable use of the public cloud environment**.
- `alert`
  - An alert is asserted when a resource is in violation of a policy as defined in an alert rule.
  - 4 alert states:
    - open,xs
    - resolved,
    - dismissed, and
    - snoozed.

to Enable Prisma Cloud Alerts
- add the cloud account to an `account group` during onboarding.
- create an `alert rule` that associates all the cloud accounts in `account group` with `policies` to generate alerts.
- You can view the alerts for all of your cloud environments directly from Prisma Cloud and drill down in to each to view specific policy violations.
- internal networks, to exclude from being flagged in an alert, Trusted IP Addresses on Prisma Cloud.

In addition, Prisma Cloud provides out-of-box ability to Configure `External Integrations on Prisma Cloud` with third-party technologies, such as SIEM platforms, ticketing systems, messaging systems, and automation frameworks so that you can continue using your existing operational, escalation, and notification tools.

To monitor your cloud infrastructures more efficiently and provide visibility in to actionable events across all your cloud workloads:
- **Generate Reports on Prisma Cloud Alerts** —on-demand or scheduled reports— on open alerts and email to stakeholders.
- **Send the Alert Payload** to a third-party tool.

## The Dashboard

**Resource Risk Ratings**
- This widget is based on the severity of the alert and the nature of the policy.
- It uses an A to F risk rating, with A being the lowest risk and F being the highest risk.

**Alerts By Severity**
- shows the number of alerts in an opened state during time range selected.
- 3 severity levels for alerts - `High, Medium and Low`.

![small-1](https://i.imgur.com/CNWK5zj.png)

**Alerts by Policy Type**
- 4 types.
- based on `data ingested from the cloud provider`
    - Config
    - Audit Event
    - Network
- based on `machine learning algorithms and user activity`
    - Anomaly

**Top Policy Violations**
- the number of alerts for a policy violation, including the name of the policy.

Internet Connections
- visualization of the number of internet users by IP address connecting to the cloud resources.

## Policies

Default and Custom Policies
- The `default policies` can be used as templates to create `custom policy`.
- After you set up the policies, any **new or existing resources** that violate these policies are automatically detected.


Predefined Policies
- Adheres to established security best practices such as `PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, and NIST`.
- Predefined policies cannot be modified.

Custom Policies
- Create custom policies to monitor for violations and enforce organizational standards.

- 4 types of policies:
  - config,
  - audit event,
  - network,
  - anomaly.

## Alerts

Alerts are generated after public cloud account connects to Prisma Cloud.

After Prisma Cloud connects to public cloud accounts and begins reading the designated logs, alerts are generated based on Prisma Cloud’s `built-in security policies and alert rules`.

These can be the default alert rules contained in the default alert group, which alerts on all policies, or policies that you have selected and associated with account groups.

Policies and Alerts
- In order for a resource to be considered clean, it must not violate any policy about its state.
- **policy**
  - A policy has a type, which indicates the underlying mechanism used to apply the policy.
- **Alerts**
  - An alert is an event tied to one or more policies that has been incorporated into an alert rule.
  - The alert is triggered when one or more of the policies has been violated by a resource.
- **Anomaly Alerts**
  - Anomaly alerts are not based on `RQL` but are based on `machine learning`.
  - Anomaly alerts cannot be cloned or modified directly.

- 4 alert states:
  - open,
  - resolved,
  - dismissed,
  - snoozed. 小睡

## Compliance Dashboard

Compliance Dashboard

Unlike the <kbd>Asset Inventory Dashboard</kbd> that `aggregates all resources and displays the pass and fail count` for all monitored resources, the <kbd>Compliance Dashboard</kbd> only displays the results for monitored resources that match the policies included within a compliance standard.


Health and Compliance
- Provides information related to the compliance posture across various compliance standards and only displays the results for monitored resources that match the policies included within a compliance standard


Reports
- Prisma Cloud enables administrators to view, assess, report, monitor, and review their cloud infrastructure health and compliance posture.


Monitored Resources
- Administrators can also create reports that contain summary and detailed findings of security and compliance risks in their cloud environment.
