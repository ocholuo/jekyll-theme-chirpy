Prisma Cloud Troubleshooting Support
- Administrators should be aware of common Prisma Cloud issues they may encounter, as well as where they can go to get help if support from Palo Alto Networks is needed.
- Common issues
  - Common issues may involve alerts not being triggered, the use of RQL to investigate security and compliance issues.
- Monitoring deployments
  - AWS value-added services, Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector, can be used to augment the monitoring of your AWS public cloud deployments.
  - Data from these services can be ingested into Prisma Cloud.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

In Prisma Cloud, a common issue is that alerts are not being generated when you first onboard your public cloud accounts.

Common Onboarding Issues
- Issues with onboarding
  - These include issues with connecting to the cloud account, and ingesting resource and vulnerability data.
- Issues with alert generation
  - In order to generate alerts, you must include your cloud accounts in an `alert rule`, and verify that the `policies` associated with the alert rule are enabled.
- Issues with RQL queries
  - These can be caused by focusing the query on the wrong type of resource, or the fact that resources in a public cloud infrastructure can be ephemeral in nature and the resources may be deleted or terminated when we submit the query.
