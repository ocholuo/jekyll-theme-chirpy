# Prisma Cloud: Integrating with Third-Party Security Applications

--

## Overview of Integration Core Concepts

Prisma Cloud can be used to integrate with existing security workflows and with the technologies you already use.


**Integrations**
- In Prisma Cloud, integrate with existing tools to achieve compliance and manage security risks across` Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Alibaba` Cloud environments.
- Options
  - Prisma Cloud provides multiple out-of-the-box integration options, which can be used to integrate Prisma Cloud into existing security workflows and technologies, as and if needed.
- Support
  - Integration support is available for both data ingestion, and for outbound alert notifications.
- Ability
  - Prisma Cloud supports the ability to enable, disable, or delete integrations.
  - So if you just need to take a third party platform offline, disable that platform in Prisma Cloud and not have to delete it and then reintegrate the target platform over again.
- Process
  - The integration process for each application differs slightly.
  - Procedures are available in the Help Center that describe the specific steps required for each third-party platform.

Integration Types
- Outbound and inbound (Export/Notifications and Ingest)
  - **Outbound - Export/Notifications**
  - to forward alerts. The advantage of using notifications is that there may be too many alerts to manage from the Prisma Cloud console. You also may want a special notification for highly critical alerts.
  - **Inbound - Ingest/Host Findings**
  - Inbound integrations provide host vulnerability data.
  - These findings are presented in resource details under the Findings tab.
  - Common inbound integrations are as follows:
    - AWS GuardDuty
    - AWS Inspector
    - Qualys
    - Tenable

## Inbound Integrations

Prisma Cloud supports the configuration of inbound integrations for the `detection and analysis of host vulnerabilities` in cloud infrastructure.

Inbound Integration Platforms
- Prisma Cloud can integrate with two platforms.
- `Qualys`
  - **vulnerability management security software**.
  - Prisma Cloud integrates with the `Qualys` platform to `ingest and visualize vulnerability data` for resources that are deployed on the AWS and Azure cloud platforms.
  - Qualys Details
    - Findings can be viewed from the Audit Trail under the Findings tab.
    - The Finding Type will indicate the source of the Finding
      - (AWS GuardDuty, AWS Inspector, Qualys, or Tenable).
    - Qualys integration works only with AWS and Azure (GCP on roadmap).
    - Data from host finding can be obtained as part of RQL using the 'config where' query type.

- `Tenable`
  - cloud-hosted **Vulnerability Management solution**
  - provides actionable insight into entire infrastructure's security risks. Prisma Cloud ingest its host findings to generate alerts.
  - provide accurate visibility and insight about dynamic assets and vulnerabilities in changing environments like the public cloud.  
  - ingest and present vulnerability data within Prisma Cloud.
  - The `Tenable.io integration` works with three cloud service providers: `AWS, Azure, and GCP`.
  - Qualys integration works only with `AWS and Azure`.
  - Data from host finding can be obtained as part of RQL using the 'config where' query type.

## Outbound Integrations

Prisma Cloud provides support for the outbound integrations for adding third-party notification channels.

Outbound Integration Platforms
- Prisma Cloud can integrate with various platforms.


[detailed step](https://beacon.paloaltonetworks.com/uploads/resource_courses/targets/1654399/original/index.html#/page/5ed91f6b64727667347e5f82)


<kbd>AWS Security Hub</kbd>
- Provides a view of the security state in AWS and helps measure compliance with the security industry standards and best practices
- It collects security data from across AWS accounts, services, and supported third-party partners and analyzes the security trends and identifies the highest priority security issues.


<kbd>Google Cloud Security Command Center</kbd>
- Can be used as a central console for centralized visibility into security and compliance risks of cloud assets on the Google Cloud Platform
- Enable the `CSCC integration` in `alert rules` so that the notifications are sent to the CSCC console


<kbd>Cortex XSOAR</kbd>
- A Palo Alto Networks company
- Cortex XSOAR is a `comprehensive security, orchestration, and response (SOAR) platform` that combines case management, automation, and real-time collaboration for security teams.


<kbd>Jira</kbd>
- An issue tracking, ticketing, and project management tool
- can be integrated to receive Prisma Cloud alert notifications in Jira accounts.
- With Jira, notification templates can be created to configure and customize Prisma Cloud alerts. Prisma Cloud will fetch all the project settings from the Jira account.


<kbd>Microsoft Teams</kbd>
- A cloud-based team collaboration platform
- part of the Office 365 suite of applications
- used for workplace chat, video meetings, file storage, and application integration.


<kbd>PagerDuty</kbd>
- Provides alerting, on-call scheduling, escalation policies, and incident tracking to increase uptime of apps, servers, websites, and databases
- PagerDuty integration sends Prisma Cloud alert information to PagerDuty service.
- The incident response teams can investigate and remediate the security incidents.


<kbd>ServiceNow</kbd>
- An incident, asset, and ticket management tool
- Prisma Cloud integrates with ServiceNow and sends notifications of `Prisma Cloud alerts` as `ServiceNow tickets`.


<kbd>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)</kbd>
- Use Amazon SQS to send, store, and receive messages between software components without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.
- Prisma Cloud supports using Amazon SQS to send alerts that can be consumed through a Splunk add-on or through CloudFormation to enable custom workflows.


<kbd>Slack</kbd>
- An online instant messaging and collaboration system that centralizes all notifications
- Alert notifications can be forwarded to a Slack channel for posting.


<kbd>Splunk</kbd>
- A cloud-based software platform
- search, analyze, and visualize machine-generated data gathered from external websites and platforms that can also receive alert notifications from Prisma Cloud.


<kbd>Webhooks</kbd>
- Integrate the Prisma Cloud Service with Webhooks to send `Prisma Cloud alerts` to Webhooks
- and pass information to any third-party integrations that are not natively supported on the Prisma Cloud service.
- Prisma Cloud can integrate with the Splunk log management system.
  - There are two methods: natively and via AWS SQS.
  - The natively method requires HTTP event collector URL and token.
  - AWS SQS uses the SQS integration + Lambda.
  - The resource config is sent with the notification and a JSON file is provided with the payload.

Integration Steps
- Prisma Cloud Steps
  - Set up a `Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC)`:
  - Use the Splunk documentation to set up the HEC.
  - For source type, use `_json`.
  - Verify the HEC is Enabled.
- Prisma Cloud Steps
  - Navigate to Settings > Integrations > Add New > Splunk

## Prisma Cloud API Support

Prisma Cloud provides support for system `RESTful APIs`.

`REST API` features.
- Method
  - The method of integration with Prisma Cloud is through the system REST APIs.
- RESTful API
  - A RESTful API is an application program interface that uses `HTTP requests`.
- Responses
  - All responses will be in JSON format.
- HTTP Methods
  - The Prisma Cloud Rest API supports the following HTTP methods: `POST, PUT, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE, and PATCH`.
