## Cortex XDR Overview

The Cortex XDR app offers complete visibility over network traffic, user behavior, and endpoint activity.
- simplifies threat investigation by `correlating logs from sensors` to reveal threat causalities and timelines.
- easily identify the root cause of every alert.
- perform immediate response actions.
- to stop future attacks, pro-actively `define IOCs and BIOCs` to detect and respond to malicious activity.

### Cortex XDR

![Screen Shot 2020-11-05 at 15.03.36](https://i.imgur.com/t7puHPo.png)

Cortex XDR
- consumes data from the <kbd>Cortex Data Lake</kbd>
- correlate and stitch together logs across different log sensors to derive event causality and timelines.

A Cortex XDR deployment which uses the full set of sensors can include the following components:
- <kbd>Cortex XDR</kbd>—The Cortex XDR app provides `complete visibility` into all data in the Cortex Data Lake. provides a single interface from which investigate and triage alerts, take remediation actions, and define policies to detect the malicious activity in the future.
- <kbd>Cortex Data Lake</kbd>—A cloud-based logging infrastructure that allows to centralize the collection and storage of logs from log data sources.
- <kbd>Cortex XDR Pro per TB</kbd>:
    - **Analytics engine**—The Cortex XDR analytics engine is a security service that utilizes network data to automatically detect and report on post-intrusion threats. The analytics engine does this by identifying good (normal) behavior on network, so that it can notice bad (anomalous) behavior.
    - **Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewalls**—On-premise or virtual firewalls that enforce network security policies in campus, branch offices, and cloud data centers.
    - **Palo Alto Networks Prisma Access and GlobalProtect**—If extend firewall security policy to mobile users and remote networks using Prisma Access or GlobalProtect, also forward related traffic logs to Cortex Data Lake. The analytics engine can then analyze those logs and raise alerts on anomalous behavior.
    - **External firewalls and alerts**—Cortex XDR can ingest traffic logs from external firewall vendors—such as Check Point—and use the analytics engine to analyze those logs and raise alerts on anomalous behavior. For additional context in incidents, also send alerts from external alert sources.
- <kbd>Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint</kbd>:
  - **Analytics engine**—The Cortex XDR analytics can also consume endpoint data to automatically detect and report on post-intrusion threats. The analytics engine can use endpoint data to raise alerts for abnormal network behavior (for example port scan activity).
  - **Cortex XDR agents**—Protects endpoints from known and unknown malware and malicious behavior and techniques. Cortex XDR agents perform its own analysis locally on the endpoint but also consumes WildFire threat intelligence. The Cortex XDR agent reports all endpoint activity to the Cortex Data Lake for analysis by Cortex XDR apps.
   - **External alert sources**—To add additional context to incidents, send Cortex XDR alerts from external sources using the Cortex XDR API.

### Cortex XDR Concepts

XDR
- With **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**, enterprises rely on endpoint data to trigger cybersecurity incidents.
- As cybercriminals and their tactics have become more sophisticated, the time to identify and contain breaches has only increased.
- XDR goes beyond the traditional EDR approach of using only endpoint data to identify and respond to threats by `applying machine learning across all enterprise, network, cloud, and endpoint data`.
- quickly find and stop targeted `attacks and insider abuse` and remediate compromised endpoints.

Sensors
- Cortex XDR `uses existing Palo Alto Networks products as sensors` to collect logs and telemetry data.
-  The sensors that are available to depend on Cortex XDR license type.
-  Cortex XDR Pro per TB license, sensor:
  - **Virtual (VM-Series) or physical firewalls**—Identifies known threats in network and cloud data center environments
  - **Prisma Access or GlobalProtect**—Identifies known threats in mobile user and remote network traffic
  - **External firewall** vendors forward traffic logs from any external vendor for analysis by the Cortex XDR analytics engine
- Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint license, sensor:
  - **Cortex XDR agents**—Identifies threats on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android endpoints and halts any malicious behavior or files
  - While more sensors increases the amount of data Cortex XDR can analyze, only need to deploy one type of sensor to begin detecting and stopping threats with Cortex XDR.

Log Stitching
-  The act of correlating logs from different sources
-  Cortex XDR `correlates together firewall network logs, endpoint raw data, and cloud data across detection sensors`.
-  `provide a complete and comprehensive picture` of the events and activity surrounding an event,
-  helps `identify the source and destination` of security processes and connections made over the network.
- Log stitching allows to:
  - Run investigation queries based on stitched network and endpoint logs
  - Create granular BIOC rules over logs from Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls and raw
  endpoint data
- Log stitching streamlines detection and reduces response time by eliminating the need for manual analysis across different data sensors.
- Stitching data across the firewalls and endpoints allows to obtain data form different sensors in a unified view, each sensor adding another layer of visibility.
- For example,
- when a connection is seen through the firewall and the endpoint,
  - the endpoint can provide information on the processes involved and on the chain of execution
  - the firewall can provide information on the amount of data transferred over the connection and the different app ids involved.

Causality Analysis Engine
- correlates activity from all detection sensors `to establish causality chains` that identify the root cause of every alert.
- identifies a complete forensic timeline of events to determine the scope and damage of an attack, and provide immediate response.
- determines the most relevant artifacts in each alert and aggregates all alerts related to an event into an incident.

Causality Chain
- When a malicious file, behavior, or technique is detected, Cortex XDR correlates available data across detection sensors to display the sequence of activity that led to the alert. This sequence of events is called the causality chain.
- The causality chain is built from processes, events, insights, and alerts associated with the activity.
- review the entire causality chain to understand why the alert occurred.

Causality Group Owner (CGO)
- the process in the causality chain that the Causality Analysis Engine identified as being responsible for or causing the activities that led to the alert.

### Cortex XDR Licenses
- Cortex XDR License Allocation
- Cortex XDR License Expiration
- Cortex XDR License Monitoring
- Migrate Cortex XDR License

#### Cortex XDR License Allocation
- With <kbd>Cortex XDR Prevent</kbd> and <kbd>Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint</kbd> licenses, Cortex XDR manages licensing for all endpoints in organization.
- Each time install a new Cortex XDR agent on an endpoint, the Cortex XDR agent registers with Cortex XDR to obtain a license.
- In the case of non-persistent VDI, the Cortex XDR agent registers with Cortex XDR as soon as the user logs in to the endpoint.
- Cortex XDR issues licenses `until exhaust the number of license seats available`.
- Cortex XDR also enforces a license cleanup policy to automatically return unused licenses to the pool of available licenses.
  - The time at which a license returns to the license pool depends on the type of endpoint:

![Screen Shot 2020-11-05 at 15.20.42](https://i.imgur.com/cxss8Tu.png)

>  If after a license is revoked the agent connects to Cortex XDR, reconnection will succeed as long as the agent has not been deleted.

#### Cortex XDR License Expiration
Cortex XDR licenses are valid for the period of time associated with the license purchase.
- After Cortex XDR license expires, Cortex XDR allows access to tenant for an additional grace period of 48 hours.
- After the 48-hour grace period, Cortex XDR disables access to the Cortex XDR app until renew the license.
- For the first 30 days of expired license, Cortex XDR continues to protect endpoints and/or network and retains data in the Cortex Data Lake according to Cortex Data Lake data retention policy and licensing.
- After 30 days, the tenant is decommissioned and agent prevention capabilities cease.

#### Cortex XDR License Monitoring
From the > Cortex XDR License dialog, view the license type associated with Cortex XDR instance.
For each license, Cortex XDR displays a tile that has the expiration date of license and additional details specific to license type:

Cortex XDR Prevent
- Displays the total number of concurrent agents permitted by license. also view a graph of the current license allocation (total and percentage).

Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint
- Displays the total number of installed agents in addition to the number and percentage of agents with Pro features enabled.
- Below the license tile, also view the storage retention policy, total amount of storage allocated for enhanced data collection, and the actual data usage.
of storage used.

Combination of Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint and Cortex XDR Pro per TB
- Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint displays the total number of installed agents, while Cortex XDR Pro per TB displays how many agents are enabled with endpoint data collection, allowing them to collect and send data to the server.

Add-Ons
- Host Insights Displays the expiration of the license.
- To keep informed of updates made to license and avoid service disruptions, Cortex XDR displays license notifications when log in. The notification identifies any changes made to license and describes any required actions.


#### Migrate Cortex XDR License
As part of the migration of Cortex XDR 1.0 to Cortex XDR 2.0, a new Cortex XDR licensing structure will go into effect.

The new licensing structure allows to better view and manage how network data and endpoints are best utilized across organization.

Cortex XDR 1.0 license was based on the amount of terabyte (TB) used for either:
- 1TB = 200 Pro per Endpoints (with EDR Collection)
- Or
- 1TB = 1TB of network traffic analysis/third party data + 200 Prevent Endpoints (without EDR collection)

The Cortex XDR 2.0 license structure is based on three Cortex XDR Licenses that purchase individually or as a combination.
- The endpoint licenses provide the number of permitted agents, either Prevent or Pro.
- The TB license identifies the amount of TB used for network traffic analysis and collecting third-party data:
- Cortex XDR Prevent license—Number of Prevent Endpoints (without EDR collection)
- Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint license—Number of Pro Endpoints (with EDR collection)
- Cortex XDR Pro per TB license—Amount of network data used for network traffic analysis and third-
party data.

### License Conversion Method and Example
Converting Cortex XDR 1.0 license to a Cortex XDR 2.0 license is calculated as follows:

Endpoints
- For each Cortex 1.0 license, 1 TB = 200 Pro per Endpoints (with EDR collection).
- The number of endpoints is converted based on the quota allocated in **Hub > Cortex Data Lake > Cortex XDR > Endpoint XDR Data**, previously Traps > Endpoint Data.

Network Data
- For each Cortex XDR 1.0 license, 1 TB = 1 TB of network data.
- Since XDR 2.0 pro per TB license no longer includes Prevent endpoints, the license does not reflect them, however, keep using them until renewal.Inc.

After migration of Cortex 2.0, when navigating to > Cortex XDR License, the license displays the converted amounts of network data or its equivalent number of endpoints allocated to license. The following table displays a conversion comparison between Cortex XDR 1.0 and 2.0 licenses.

Cortex XDR 1.0 License
- Cortex XDR 1.0 PAN-MGFR-XDR-1TB license - 100TB
- Hub > Cortex Data Lake > Traps > Endpoint Data - 10TB Endpoint Data.

Post Migration Cortex
- Up to 20,000 Pro per Endpoints
- Up to 100TB for network traffic analysis and third-party data

### Plan Cortex XDR Deployment
Before get started with Cortex XDR, plan deployment:
1. Use the <kbd>Cortex Data Lake Calculator</kbd> to determine the amount of log storage need for Cortex XDR deployment. Talk to Partner or Sales Representative to determine whether must purchase additional Cortex Data Lake storage.
2. Determine the region in which want to host Cortex XDR and any associated services, such as Cortex Data Lake and Directory Sync Service:
   - US—All Cortex XDR logs and data remain within the US boundary.
   - UK—All Cortex XDR logs and data remain within the UK boundary.
   - EU—All Cortex XDR logs and data remain within the Europe boundary.
   - SG—All Cortex XDR logs and data remain within the Singapore boundary.
   - JP—All Cortex XDR logs and data remain within the Japan boundary.
3. (Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint license only) Calculate the `bandwidth required` to support the number of agents plan to deploy. need 1.2Mbps of bandwidth for every 1,000 agents. The bandwidth requirement scales linearly so, for example, to support 100,000 agents, need to allocate 120Mbps of bandwidth.
4. **Manage Roles** to ensure or the person who is activating Cortex apps has the appropriate permissions.
5. When are ready to get started with a new tenant, Activate Cortex XDR.


### Manage Roles
Role-based access control (RBAC) enables to use roles or specific permissions to assign access rights to administrative users. manage roles for all Cortex apps and services in the hub. By assigning roles, enforce the separation of viewing access and initiating actions among functional or regional areas of organization. The following options are available to help manage access rights:
- Assign Predefined User Roles for Cortex XDR
- Create and save new roles based on the granular permission
- Edit role permissions (available for roles create)
- Assign permissions to users without saving a role
Use roles to assign specific view and action access privileges to administrative user accounts. The way configure administrative access depends on the security requirements of organization. The built-in roles provide specific access rights that cannot be changed. The roles create provide more granular access control.
When organization purchases Cortex XDR, the Account Administrator can use the Palo Alto Networks hub to assign roles to other members that have accounts in the Customer Support Portal.
To activate Cortex XDR apps, must be assigned either the Account Administrator or App Administrator role for Cortex XDR. If are activating a new Cortex Data Lake instance must also be assigned either administrative role for Cortex Data Lake.
After activation, Account Administrators can assign additional users roles to manage apps. If the user only needs to manage a specific instance of an app, assign the Instance Administrator role.
To assign the roles, Account Administrators (or users that are assigned the App Administrator for the relevant app) can take the following steps:
- STEP 1 | If necessary, add a new Customer Support Portal user.
To be eligible for role assignment in the hub, the user must have an account in the Customer Support Portal (https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/) and be assigned any of the following Customer Support Portal roles: Super User, Standard User, or Limited User. Skip this step if the user already has a Customer Support Portal account with an appropriate role.
- STEP 2 | Manage the level of access for a Cortex XDR user.
1. Log in to the hub and select > Access Management.
2. Use the sidebar to filter users as needed or the search field to search for users.
3. Select one or more users and then Assign Roles

 1. In the Assign Roles page for each instance, select one of the following options:
- Assign Permissions—Create a new role or assign selected permissions.
- Cortex XDR Predefined Role—Select one of the predefined Cortex XDR role. Select Role
Definitions to view a list of the Cortex predefined roles and the allocated views and actions.
- No Role—User is not assigned any view or action access to the Cortex XDR app.
5. (Optional) To create a new role:
1. After selected Assign Permissions, in the Assign Custom Permissions pop-up, select which IN_APP VIEWS and IN_APP ACTIONS permissions want to grant.
2. Save As New Role to create a new role that apply to other users, or Save to apply the selected permissions to the user without a defined role.
The new rule is displayed with User Created (UC) icon. Select the role to apply permissions to the user and then Save

  6. (Optional) To edit or clone a user created role:
1. Select > Access Management > Manage Roles.
2. In the Manage Roles Cortex XDR page, find user created role and select Actions.
3. Edit Permissions, Clone, or Delete role, as desired.

Predefined User Roles for Cortex XDR
Role-based access control (RBAC) enables to use preconfigured roles to assign access rights to administrative users. manage roles for all Cortex apps and services in the hub. By assigning roles, enforce the separation of access among functional or regional areas of organization.
Each role extends specific privileges to users. The way configure administrative access depends on the security requirements of organization. Use roles to assign specific access privileges to administrative user accounts. The built-in roles provide specific access rights that cannot be changed. Use hub roles to provide full access to Cortex XDR with three levels: Account, App, or Instance. If desire more granular access control, assign any of the Cortex XDR app roles.
The following table describes the Cortex XDR predefined roles and the view and action privileges associated with each.
Some features are license dependent. As a result users may not see a specific feature if the feature is not supported by the license type or if they do not have access based on their assigned role.


### Activate Network Devices
With a Cortex XDR Pro per TB license, if use Palo Alto Networks firewalls as a traffic log source, must activate firewalls and Panorama. If use Panorama to manage firewalls, must activate firewalls before continue with activation of Cortex XDR. If only use one firewall or use multiple firewalls but do not manage them using Panorama, activate firewalls after activate Cortex XDR.
- STEP 1 | Register and activate firewalls and Panorama.
- STEP 2 | Onboard Panorama-Managed Firewalls to Cortex Data Lake.
- STEP 3 | Upgrade firewalls and Panorama to the latest software and content releases.
PAN-OS 8.0.6 is the minimum required software release version for Palo Alto Networks firewalls and Panorama. However, to enable Cortex XDR to leverage the Directory Sync Service and Enhanced Application Logs, upgrade firewalls and Panorama to PAN-OS 8.1.1 or later and to the latest content release:
Get the latest application and threat content updates. Upgrade to PAN-OS 8.1.1.
- STEP 4 | Ensure that firewalls have visibility into internal traffic and applications.
It’s important that at least one firewall sending logs to the Cortex Data Lake is processing or has visibility
into internal traffic and applications.
If have deployed only internet gateway firewalls, one option might be to configure a tap interface to give a firewall visibility into data center traffic even though the firewall is not in the traffic flow. Connect the tap mode interface to a data center switch SPAN or mirror port that provides the firewall with the mirrored traffic, and make sure that the firewall is enabled to log the traffic and send it to the Cortex Data Lake.
Because data center firewalls already have visibility into internal network traffic, don’t need to configure these firewalls in tap mode; however, contact Palo Alto Networks Professional Services for best practices to ensure that the Cortex Data Lake and Cortex XDR-required configuration updates do not affect data center firewall deployments.
- STEP 5 | Configure firewalls to forward Cortex XDR-required logs to Cortex Data Lake.
The Cortex Data Lake provides centralized, cloud-based log storage for firewalls, and Panorama provides an interface use to view the stored logs. The rich log data that firewalls forward to the Cortex Data Lake provides the Cortex XDR analytics engine the network visibility it requires to perform data analytics.
To support Cortex XDR, firewalls must forward at least Traffic logs to the Cortex Data Lake. The complete set of log types that a firewall should forward to the Cortex Data Lake are:
  Traffic (required) URL Filtering User-ID Configuration Correlation
HIP
System Logs
Enhanced application logs (PAN-OS 8.1.1 or later)

 Enhanced application logs are designed to increase visibility into network activity for Palo Alto Networks Cloud Services apps, and Cortex XDR requires these logs to support certain features.
Follow the complete workflow to configure Panorama-managed firewalls to forward logs to the Cortex Data Lake.


### Activate Cortex XDR
Use the hub (https://apps.paloaltonetworks.com) to activate Cortex XDR.

To activate the Cortex XDR app, must be assigned a required role and locate activation email containing a link to begin activation in the hub.

Activating Cortex XDR automatically includes activation of Cortex Data Lake.
- STEP 1 | Begin activation.
  1. Click the activation link received in email
  2. If manage multiple company CSP accounts, make sure select the specific account to which
  want to allocate the Cortex XDR license to before proceeding with activation.
  The hub will associate activation of Cortex XDR and the included apps and services
  only with the selected account.
  3. From the Cortex XDR tile, select the serial number want to activate.
  If there is only one serial number associated with company account, click the tile to begin activation.
  If have multiple serial numbers associated, click each one to activate.

- STEP 2 | Provide details about the Cortex XDR app you’re activating.
  - Company Account—Identifies the company account under which are activating Cortex XDR.
  - Name—Give Cortex XDR app instance an easily-recognizable name and optional Description.
  If have more than one Cortex XDR instance, the hub displays the name in the instance list when select the Cortex XDR tile. Choose a name that is 59 or fewer characters and is unique across company account.
  - Subdomain—Give Cortex XDR instance an easy to recognize name. The hub displays the name assign on the list of available instances for the Cortex XDR app. also access the Cortex XDR app directly using the full URL (https:// <subdomain>.xdr. <region>.paloaltonetworks.com). If are converting an existing Traps management service to Cortex XDR, this field is grayed out.
  - Cortex Data Lake—Select the Cortex Data Lake instance that will provide the Cortex XDR apps with log data.
  - If activated with an auth code, provision a new Cortex Data Lake instance by selecting the link to activate purchased licenses and provide the separate Cortex Data Lake auth code received in email.
  - If activated with the activation link, automatically provision a new Cortex Data Lake instance in the region select or select an existing Cortex Data Lake and increase its size. only select a Cortex Data Lake instance that is not allocated to another Cortex XDR instance. When select a Cortex Data Lake instance, the hub provisions Cortex XDR instance in the same region
  - Region—Select a region in which want to set up Cortex Data Lake instance. If selected an existing Cortex Data Lake instance, this field automatically displays the region in which Cortex Data Lake instance is deployed and cannot be changed.
  - Directory Sync—(Optional) Select the Directory Sync Service instance that will provide the Cortex XDR app with Active Directory data. If there is only one Directory Sync Service instance for the selected Cortex Data Lake region, the hub automatically selects it for pairing with the Cortex XDR app, however clear the default selection, if desired. If do not currently have a Directory Sync Service activated and configured for account, select the link to create an instance now, or add one at a later time.

- STEP 3 | Review the end user license agreement and Agree & Activate.
  - The hub displays the activation status as it activates and provisions apps. It can take up to an hour to complete activation. After activation completes, the hub displays a summary that shows the details for apps and services.

- STEP 4 | Manage Apps to view the current status of apps.
  - When the app is available will see a green check mark in the STATUS column. To return to the status page at a later time, return to the hub and select > Manage Apps.
- STEP 5 | When app is available, log in to Cortex XDR app
- STEP 6 | Allocate Log Storage for Cortex XDR.
- STEP 7 | Assign roles to additional administrators, if needed.
- STEP 8 |Complete configuration.

> If have a Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint license, continue to Set up Endpoint Protection. Otherwise
proceed to Set up Network Analysis



### Set Up Directory Sync
Directory Sync is an optional service that enables to leverage Active Directory user, group, and computer information in Cortex XDR apps to provide context when investigate alerts. use Active Directory information in `policy configuration and endpoint management`.

> After finish the setup, Cortex XDR syncs with Directory Sync every 24 hours.

To set up Directory Sync:
- STEP 1 | Add and configure Directory Sync instance.
  - Activate Directory Sync
  - See the Directory Sync Service Getting Started Guide for instructions.
- STEP 2 | Pair the Directory Sync to Cortex XDR apps.
  - Pairing can occur during Cortex XDR activation or after activate Cortex XDR apps.
- STEP 3 | After activate and pair Cortex XDR apps with Directory Sync, must define which Active    
  - Directory domain the analytics engine should use.
Wait about ten minutes after have paired Directory Sync before do this.

#### Pairing Directory Sync
If did not pair Directory Sync to Cortex apps during Cortex XDR activation, later pair it with Cortex XDR instance.
- STEP 1 | Log into the hub.
- STEP 2 | Click the gear > Manage Apps in the upper-right corner.
- STEP 3 | Locate the Directory Sync instance that want to use with Cortex XDR. Make a note of the instance's name, which appears in the left-most column.
  - If have more than one instance, make sure choose the instance that is in the same region as the Cortex Data Lake instance are using with apps.
- STEP 4 | Pair the Directory Sync instance with Cortex XDR instance.
  1. Scroll down until find Cortex XDR instance in the Cortex XDR section.
  2. Click on its name in the left-most column
  3. In the resulting pop-up configuration screen, select the desired Directory Sync instance, and then click OK.

### Allocate Log Storage for Cortex XDR
receive Cortex Data Lake log storage based on the amount of storage associated with Cortex XDR Licenses.

Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint and Cortex XDR Pro per TB licenses grant a daily ingestion quota of the number of TBs / 30 in addition to the same amount of TBs in storage.
- For example: Cortex XDR Pro per TB 10
- Daily ingestion quota calculated according to 10TB / 30 = 333GB
- Storage = 10TB

When activate Cortex XDR, Cortex Data Lake assigns a default storage allocation for logs, EDR data, and alerts.

While some Cortex apps receive a default allocation, with a Cortex XDR Pro per TB license, must manually allocate storage for firewall logs.

Cortex Data Lake displays the current possible allocation but does not display the storage usage.

After activate Cortex XDR, review and adjust log storage allocation depending on storage requirements.

To allocate log storage quota:
- STEP 1 | Sign In to the Palo Alto Networks hub at https://apps.paloaltonetworks.com/.
- STEP 2 | Select Cortex Data Lake instance.
- STEP 3 | Select Configuration to define logging storage settings.
- STEP 4 | Allocate quota for Cortex XDR.
  1. If purchased quota for firewall logs, allocate quota to the Firewall log type.
  2. To use the same Cortex Data Lake instance for both firewall logs and Cortex XDR logs, must first `associate Panorama with the Cortex Data Lake instance` before allocate quota for firewall logs.
  3. Review storage allocation for Cortex XDR according to the formula:
  4. By default, 80% of available storage for Cortex XDR is assigned to logs and data, and 20% is assigned to alerts.
  5. It is recommended to review the status of Cortex Data Lake instance after about two weeks of data collection and make adjustments as needed but to use the default allocations as a starting point.
  6. Use the Cortex Data Lake Calculator to calculate how many logs are ingested and add additional TBs accordingly.
- STEP 5 | Apply changes.
- STEP 6 | Monitor data retention.
  - Cortex XDR retains endpoint data according to the allocated quota in Cortex XDR Data Lake.
  - Make sure data retention is sufficient for environment.
  - By default, Cortex XDR will not remove data less than 30 days, however must allocate the quotain order for Cortex XDR to support the retention.
  1. From Cortex XDR, navigate to > Cortex XDR License.
  2. In the Endpoint XDR Data Retention section, review the following:
     - Current number of days data has been stored in Cortex XDR Data Lake. The count begins the as soon as activate Cortex XDR.
     - Number of retention days permitted according to the quota allocated.
3. If needed, update Cortex XDR allocated quota.


### Set up Endpoint Protection

The <kbd>Cortex XDR agent</kbd> `monitors endpoint activity` and `collects endpoint data` that Cortex XDR uses to raise alerts.
- Before begin collecting endpoint data, must `deploy the Cortex XDR agent` and `configure endpoint policy`.
- To use endpoint management functions in Cortex XDR must be assigned an administrative role in the hub.

- STEP 1 | Verify the status of Cortex XDR tenant.
  1. hub > Manage Apps > STATUS, When Cortex XDR tenant is available, the status changes to the green check mark.
- STEP 2 | Plan Agent Deployment.
- STEP 3 | **Enable Access to Cortex XDR**.
- STEP 4 | (Optional) Set up Broker VM communication.
- STEP 5 | **Install the Cortex XDR agent on endpoints**.
  1. `Install the agent software` directly on an endpoint or use a software deployment tool (such as JAMF or GPO) to distribute and install the software on multiple endpoints.
  2. Create an `Agent Installation Package`.
  3. `Install the Cortex XDR agent`.
- STEP 6 | Define Endpoint Groups to which apply endpoint security policy.
- STEP 7 | **Customize Endpoint Security Profiles and assign them to endpoints**.
  - Cortex XDR provides out-of-the box exploit and malware protection.
  - However  must enable <kbd>Data Collection<kbd> in an `Agent Settings profile` to leverage endpoint data in Cortex XDR apps.
  - Data collection for Windows endpoints is available with Traps 6.0 and later releases and on endpoints running Windows 7 SP1 and later releases.
  - Data collection on macOS and Linux endpoints are available with Traps 6.1 and later releases.
- STEP 8 | (Optional) Configure Device Control profiles to restrict file execution on USB-connected devices.
- STEP 9 | Verify that the Cortex XDR agent can connect to Cortex XDR instance.
  - If successful, the Cortex XDR console displays a Connected status.
  - view the status of all agents: `Endpoints > Endpoint Management` of Cortex XDR interface.
- STEP 10 | **Configure the internal networks that want Cortex XDR to monitor**.
  1. Log in to Cortex XDR app
  2. To view existing network segments: `Analytics Management > Status > Analytics Network Coverage Status`.
     1. This page provides a table of the IP address ranges Cortex XDR Analytics monitors, which is pre-populated with the default IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces
     2. To add custom network segments, select `Configuration` and then `Network Segments Configuration`.
  3. Add a new segment and enter the first and last IP address of the range to monitor.
  4. Save the network segment. If the Configuration saved notification does not appear, save again.
- STEP 11 | If also have a Cortex XDR Pro per TB license, proceed to Set up Network Analysis. Otherwise, proceed to Configure XDR.

#### Plan Agent Deployment
typically deploy Cortex XDR agent software to endpoints across a network after an initial `proof of concept (POC)`, which simulates corporate production environment.
- During the POC or deployment stage, analyze security events to determine which are triggered by malicious activity and which are due to legitimate processes behaving in a risky or incorrect manner.
- also simulate the number and types of endpoints, the user profiles, and the types of applications that run on the endpoints in organization and, according to these factors, define, test, and adjust the **security policy** for organization.

> The goal of this multi-step process is to provide maximum protection to the organization without interfering with legitimate workflows.


- After the successful completion of the initial POC, we recommend a multi-step implementation in the corporate production environment for the following reasons:
  - The POC doesn't always reflect all the variables that exist in production environment.
  - There is a rare chance that the Cortex XDR agent will affect business applications, which can reveal vulnerabilities in the software as a prevented attack.
  - During the POC, it is much easier to isolate issues that appear and provide a solution before full implementation in a large environment where issues could affect a large number of users.

A multi-step deployment approach ensures a smooth implementation and deployment of the Cortex XDR solution throughout network. Use the following steps for better support and control over the added protection.
0. Calculate the bandwidth required to support the number of agents plan to deploy.
1. Install Cortex XDR on endpoints.
2. Expand the Cortex XDR deployment.
3. Complete the Cortex XDR installation.
4. Define corporate policy and protected processes.
5. Refine corporate policy and protected processes.
6. Finalize corporate policy and protected processes.


#### Enable Access to Cortex XDR
After receive account details, enable and verify access to Cortex XDR.

> Some of the IP addresses required for access are registered in the United States. As a result, some GeoIP databases do not correctly pinpoint the location in which IP addresses are used. In regard to customer data, Cortex Data Lake stores all data in deployment region, regardless of the IP address registration and restricts data transmission through any infrastructure to that region. For considerations, see Plan Cortex XDR Deployment.
>
> Throughout this topic, <xdr-tenant> refers to the chosen subdomain of Cortex XDR tenant and <region> is the region in which Cortex Data Lake is deployed (see Plan Cortex XDR Deployment for supported regions).


- STEP 1 | (Optional) If are deploying the broker VM as a proxy between Cortex XDR and the Cortex XDR agents, start by enabling the communication between them.
- STEP 2 | In firewall configuration, enable access to Cortex XDR communication servers and storage buckets.
  - With Palo Alto Networks firewalls, we recommend that use the following `App-IDs` to allow communication between Cortex XDR agents and Cortex XDR management console when configure security policy:
  - **cortex-xdr**—Requires PAN-OS Applications and Threats content update version 8279 or a later release.
  - **traps-management-service**—Requires PAN-OS Applications and Threats content update version 793 or a later release.
  - If **do not use Palo Alto Networks firewalls**, ensure that configure firewall policy to enable communication with the FQDNs.

FQDN | App-ID Coverage
---|---
`distributions.traps.paloaltonetworks.com` | traps-management-service | Used for the first request in registration flow where the agent passes the distribution id and obtains the `ch- <tenant>.traps.paloaltonetworks.com` of its tenant
`dc-<xdr-tenant>.traps.paloaltonetworks.com` | traps-management-service | Used for EDR data upload.
`ch-<xdr-tenant>.traps.paloaltonetworks.com` | traps-management-service | Used for all other requests between the agent and its tenant server including heartbeat, uploads, action results, and scan reports.
`cc-<xdr-tenant>.traps.paloaltonetworks.com` | traps-management-service |  Used for get-verdict requests.
`wss://lrc-<region>.paloaltonetworks.com`| cortex-xdr | Used in live terminal flow.
`panw-xdr-installers-prod- us.storage.googleapis.com` | cortex-xdr | Used to download installers for upgrade actions from the server. This storage bucket is used for all regions.
`panw-xdr-payloads-prod- us.storage.googleapis.com` | cortex-xdr | sed to download the executable for live terminal for Cortex XDR agents earlier than version 7.1.0. This storage bucket is used for all regions.
`global-content-profiles- policy.storage.googleapis.com` | cortex-xdr | Used to download content updates.
`panw-xdr-evr- prod-<region>.storage.googleapis.com` | cortex-xdr | Used to download extended verdict request results in scanning.

- STEP 3 | To **establish secure communication (TLS) to Cortex XDR**, the endpoints, and any other devices that initiate a TLS connection with Cortex, must have the following certificates installed on the operating system:

Certificate | Fingerprint
---|---
GoDaddy Root Certificate Authority - G2 (Godaddy) | - **SHA1 Fingerprint**—47 BE AB C9 22 EA E8 0E 78 78 34 62 A7 9F 45 C2 54 FD E6 8B <br> - **SHA256 Fingerprint**—45 14 0B 32 47 EB 9C C8 C5 B4 F0 D7 B5 30 91 F7 32 92 08 9E 6E 5A 63 E2 74 9D D3 AC A9 19 8E DA
lobalSign (Google) | - **SHA1 Fingerprint**—75 E0 AB B6 13 85 12 27 1C 04 F8 5F DD DE 38 E4 B7 24 2E FE <br> - **SHA256 Fingerprint**—CA 42 DD 41 74 5F D0 B8 1E B9 02 36 2C F9 D8 BF 71 9D A1 BD 1B 1E FC 94 6F 5B 4C 99 F4 2C 1B 9E

- STEP 4 | If use SSL decryption, we recommend that do not decrypt Cortex XDR services.
  - To exclude Cortex XDR services from decryption, add the following domains to SSL Decryption

Exclusion list where `<region>` is deployment region:
- `*.traps.paloaltonetworks.com`
- `*.xdr.<region>.paloaltonetworks.com`
- `app-proxy.<region>.paloaltonetworks.com`
- `panw-xdr-evr-prod-<region>.storage.googleapis.com`
- `panw-xdr-installers-prod-us.storage.googleapis.com`
- `panw-xdr-payloads-prod-us.storage.googleapis.com`
- `global-content-profiles-policy.storage.googleapis.com`
- `lrc-<region>.paloaltonetworks.com`

> In PAN-OS 8.0 and later releases, configure the list in Device > Certificate Management > SSL Decryption Exclusion.

- STEP 5 | (Windows only) Enable access for Windows CRL checks.
  - (Endpoints running the following or later releases: Traps 6.0.3, Traps 6.1.1, and Cortex XDR 7.0) When the Cortex XDR agent examines portable executables (PEs) running on the endpoint as part of the enforced Malware Security Profile, the agent performs a certificate revocation (CRL) check. The CRL check ensures that the certificate used to sign a given PE is still considered valid by its Certificate Authority (CA), and has not been revoked. To validate the certificate, the Cortex XDR agent leverages Microsoft Windows APIs and triggers the operating system to fetch the specific Certificate Revocation List (CRL) from the internet. To complete the certificate revocation check, the endpoint needs HTTP access to a dynamic list of URLs, based on the PEs that are executed or scanned on the endpoint.
  1. If a system-wide proxy is defined for the endpoint (statically or using a PAC file), Microsoft Windows downloads the CRL lists through the proxy.
  2. If a specific proxy is defined for the Cortex XDR agent, and the endpoint has no access to the internet over HTTP, then Microsoft Windows will fail to download the CRL lists. As a result, the certificate revocation check will fail and the certificate will be considered valid by the agent, while creating a latency in executing PEs. If the Cortex XDR agent is running in an isolated environment that prohibits the successful completion of certificate revocation checks, the Palo Alto Networks Support team can provide a configuration file that will disable the revocation checks and avoid unnecessary latency in the execution time of PEs.

- STEP 6 | (Windows only) Enable serverless peer-to-peer (P2) content updates
  - By default, the Cortex XDR agent retrieves content updates from its peer Cortex XDR agents on the same subnet. To enable P2P, must enable UDP and TCP over port 33221. change the port number or choose to download the content directly from the Cortex XDR sever in the Agent settings profile.


- STEP 7 | Verify that access Cortex XDR tenant.
  - After download and install the Cortex XDR agent software on endpoints and configure endpoint security policy, verify that the Cortex XDR agents can check in with Cortex XDR to receive the endpoint policy.

#### Proxy Communication
configure communication through proxy servers between the Cortex XDR server and the Cortex XDR agents running on Windows, Mac, and Linux endpoints. The Cortex XDR agent uses the proxy settings defined as part of the Internet & Network settings or WPAD protocol on the endpoint. also configure a list of proxy servers that Cortex XDR agent will use to communicate the with Cortex XDR server.

Cortex XDR supports the following types of proxy configurations:
- System-wide proxy—Use system-wide proxy to send all communication on the endpoint including to and from the Cortex XDR agent through a proxy server configured for the endpoint. Cortex XDR supports proxy communication for proxy settings defined explicitly on the endpoint, as well as proxy settings configured in a proxy auto-config (PAC) file.
- Application-specific proxy—(Available with Traps agent 5.0.9, Traps agent 6.1.2, and Cortex XDR agent 7.0 and later releases) Configure a Cortex XDR specific proxy that applies only to the Cortex XDR agent and does not enforce proxy communications with other apps or services on endpoint. set up to five proxy servers either during the Cortex XDR agent installation process, or following agent installation, directly from the Cortex XDR management console.

If the endpoints in environment are not connected directly to the internet, deploy a Palo Alto Networks broker VM.

Application-specific proxy configurations take precedence over system-wide proxy configurations. The Cortex XDR agent retrieves the proxy list defined on the endpoint and tries to establish communication with the Cortex XDR server first through app-specific proxies. Then, if communication is unsuccessful, the agent tries to connect using the system-wide proxy, if defined. If none are defined, the Cortex XDR agent attempts communication with the Cortex XDR server directly.


### Set up Network Analysis
With a Cortex XDR Pro per TB license must set up network sensors and define network coverage for internal networks.
- STEP 1 | Set up network sensors.
  1. If use unmanaged Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and did not configure log-forwarding on firewalls before activating Cortex XDR, Start Sending Logs to Cortex Data Lake.
  2. (Optional) Ingest Data from External Sources. If have external (non-Palo Alto Networks) network sensors, set up a syslog collector to receive alerts or logs from them. If send external alerts, Cortex XDR can include any them in relevant incidents for a more complete picture of the activity involved. If send logs and alerts from external sources such as Check Point firewalls, Cortex XDR can apply analytics analysis and raise analytics alerts on the external logs and include the external alerts in incidents for additional context.
  3. (Optional) If use Okta or Azure AD, Ingest Authentication Logs and Data into authentication stories. After set up log collection, search for authentication data using the Query Builder.
  4. (Optional) If want to use Pathfinder to examine network hosts, servers, and workstations for malicious or risky software, Set Up Pathfinder. If want to use Pathfinder to supplement the Cortex XDR agent or choose not to use Cortex XDR for endpoint protection, Set Up Pathfinder.
- STEP 2 | Configure the internal networks that want Cortex XDR to monitor.
  1. Log in to Cortex XDR app either using the direct link or from the Cortex XDR tile on the hub.
  2. To view existing network segments, select the gear (   ) in the upper right corner and select Analytics Management > Status > Analytics Network Coverage Status. This page provides a table of the IP address ranges Cortex XDR Analytics monitors, which is pre-populated with the default IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces.
  3. To add custom network segments, select Configuration and then Analytics Network Coverage Status.
  4. Add (   ) a new segment and enter the first and last IP address of the range to monitor.
  5. Specify the Assigned Pathfinder VM to assign a Pathfinder VM to the network segment. If do not want Pathfinder to scan a particular segment, then leave the field blank.
  6. (Optional) If want to further limit Pathfinder scans to specific devices, go to the Pathfinder page and then select Per Asset Configuration. Use these settings to override the default Pathfinder configuration on a per-asset basis.
  7. Leave Reserved for VPN blank. See the following step for adding GlobalProtect VPN IP address pool to the Cortex XDR app as a network segment to monitor.
  8. Save (   ) the network segment. If the Configuration saved notification does not appear, save again.
- STEP 3 | If use GlobalProtect or Prisma Access, add the GlobalProtect VPN IP address pool for the VPN traffic that want to monitor.
  1. To enable the Cortex XDR app to analyze VPN traffic, add (+) a new segment and specify the first and last IP address of GlobalProtect VPN IP address pool.
  2. Leave the Pathfinder VM assignment blank for GlobalProtect VPN IP address pool network segments. The app creates virtual profiles of endpoints from VPN traffic from the username- associated traffic, and Pathfinder cannot scan those virtual profiles.
  3. Identify this network segment as Reserved for VPN. GlobalProtect dynamically assigns IP addresses from the IP pool to the mobile endpoints that connect to network. The Cortex XDR analytics engine creates virtual entity profiles for network segments that are reserved for VPN
  4. Save (   ) the network segment. If the Configuration saved notification does not appear, save again.
- STEP 4 | After have configured the analytics engine, wait about an hour, and then verify that Cortex XDR is receiving alerts on the various networks that the analytics engine is monitoring.
  1. To view existing network segments, select > Analytics Management > Status and then select Analytics Network Coverage Status.
  2. Select the report duration, or enter a custom date and time range, and click Generate.
  3. Verify that the IP ranges match the network segments the firewall sees; the DNS % should be over
  4.  The DHCP % column should reflect the correct percentage for IP ranges that contain endpoints
  with dynamic IP addresses.
  4. In a deployment with GlobalProtect or Prisma Access, verify that the app generates alerts on VPN
  traffic.
- STEP 5 | If want to use Pathfinder to interrogate endpoints for risky or malicious software, Set Up Pathfinder.
  - If also use Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint, use Pathfinder to supplement endpoint detection
using the Cortex XDR agent.
- STEP 6 | If selected a Directory Sync Service instance during the Cortex XDR activation process, configure Cortex XDR to use it.


#### Ingest Data from External Sources
To provide with a more complete and detailed picture of the activity involved in an incident, ingest data from a variety of external, third-party sources in Cortex XDR. Depending on the source, Cortex XDR can receive logs or both logs and alerts from the source. Cortex XDR can stitch the logs together with other logs and can raise provided alerts in relevant incidents.
To ingest data, must set up the syslog collector applet on a broker VM within network. The applet can receive logs and alerts from external sources.


#### Ingest External Alerts
For a more complete and detailed picture of the activity involved in an incident, Cortex XDR can ingest alerts from any external source. Cortex XDR stitches the external alerts together with relevant endpoint data and displays alerts from external sources in relevant incidents and alerts tables. also see external alerts and related artifacts and assets in Causality views.

To ingest alerts from an external source, configure alert source to forward alerts (in CEF format) to the syslog collector. also ingest alerts from external sources using the Cortex XDR API.

After Cortex XDR begins receiving external alerts, must map the following required fields to the Cortex XDR format:
- Timestamp
- Severity
- Source IP address
- Source port
- Destination IP address
- Destination port

> If send pre-parsed alerts using the Cortex XDR API, additional mapping is not required.

Storage of external alerts is determined by Cortex Data Lake data retention policy. To ingest external alerts:
- STEP 1 | **Send alerts from an external source to Cortex XDR**.
  - There are two ways to send alerts:
  - **Cortex XDR API**
    - Use the `insert_cef_alerts API` to send the `raw CEF syslog alerts`
    - or use the `insert_parsed_alerts API` to `convert the CEF syslog alerts to the Cortex XDR format` before sending them to Cortex XDR.
    - If use the API to send logs, do not need to perform the additional mapping step in Cortex XDR.
  - **Activate Syslog collector**
    - `Activate the syslog collector `
    - and then `configure the alert source` to forward alerts in CEF format to the syslog collector.
    - Then configure an alert mapping rule as follows.
- STEP 2 | In **Cortex XDR > Settings > External Alerts**.
- STEP 3 | Right-click the **Vendor Product for alerts > Filter and Map**.
- STEP 4 | Use the filters to narrow the results to the alerts want to map.
  - Cortex XDR displays a limited sample of results during the mapping rule creation.
  - As define filters, Cortex XDR applies the filter to the limited sample but does not apply the filters across all alerts.
  - As a result, might not see any results from the alert sample during the rule creation.
- STEP 5 | Click Next to begin a new mapping rule.
  1. On the left, define a Name and optional Description to identify mapping rule.
  2. Map each required Cortex XDR field to a field in alert source.
  3. If needed, use the field converter () to translate the source field to the Cortex XDR syntax.
  4. For example, if use a different severity system, need to use the converter to map severities fields to the Cortex XDR risks of High, Medium, and Low. also use regex to convert the fields to extract the data to facilitate matching with the Cortex XDR format. For example, say need to map the port but source field contains both IP address and port (192.168.1.200:8080). To extract everything after the :, use the following regex: `^[^:]*_`
  5. For additional context when are investigating an incident, also map additional optional fields to fields in alert source.
- STEP 6 | Submit alert filter and mapping rule when finished.


#### Ingest Logs from Check Point Firewalls
If use Check Point firewalls, still take advantage of Cortex XDR investigation and detection capabilities by forwarding Check Point firewall logs to Cortex XDR. By forwarding firewall logs, Cortex XDR can examine network traffic to detect anomalous behavior. Cortex XDR can use Check Point firewall logs as the sole data source, but can also use Check Point firewall logs in conjunction with Palo Alto Networks firewall logs. For additional endpoint context, also use Traps to collect and alert on endpoint data.
As an estimate for initial sizing, note that the average Check Point log size is roughly 700 bytes. For proper sizing calculations, test the log sizes and log rates produced by Check Point firewalls

 As soon as Cortex XDR starts to receive logs, the app can begin analyzing and raising Analytics alerts. Cortex XDR stores Analytics alerts according to Cortex Data Lake storage retention policy but does not store the Check Point firewall logs. As a result,not query or apply IOC and BIOC rule matching to Check Point firewall logs.
To integrate logs, first need to set up an applet in a broker VM within network to act as a syslog collector. then configure firewall policy to log all traffic and set up the Log Exporter on Check Point Log Server to forward logs to the syslog collector in a CEF format.
- STEP 1 | Activate the Syslog Collector.
- STEP 2 | Configure the Check Point firewall to forward syslog events in CEF format to the syslog
collector.
Configure firewall policy to log all traffic and set up the Log Exporter to forward logs to the syslog collector. By logging all traffic, enable Cortex XDR to detect anomalous behavior from Check Point firewall logs. For more information on setting up Log Exporter, see the Check Point documentation.


#### Ingest Logs from Cisco ASA Firewalls
If use Cisco ASA firewalls, still take advantage of Cortex XDR investigation and detection capabilities by forwarding firewall logs to Cortex XDR. This enables Cortex XDR to examine network traffic to detect anomalous behavior. Cortex XDR can use Cisco ASA firewall logs as the sole data source, but can also use Cisco ASA firewall logs in conjunction with Palo Alto Networks firewall logs. For additional endpoint context, also use Cortex XDR to collect and alert on endpoint data.
As an estimate for initial sizing, note that the average Cisco ASA log size is roughly 180 bytes. For proper sizing calculations, test the log sizes and log rates produced by Cisco ASA firewalls.
As soon as Cortex XDR starts to receive logs, the app can begin analyzing and raising Analytics alerts. Cortex XDR stores Analytics alerts according to Cortex Data Lake storage retention policy but does not store the Cisco ASA firewall logs. As a result,not query or apply IOC and BIOC rule matching to Cisco ASA firewall logs.
To integrate logs, first need to set up an applet in a broker VM within network to act as a syslog collector. then configure forwarding on log devices to send logs to the syslog collector.
- STEP 1 | Activate the Syslog Collector.
- STEP 2 | Configure the Cisco ASA firewall or the log device forwarding logs from it to log to the syslog
collector.
Configure firewall policy to log all traffic and forward the traffic logs to the syslog collector. By logging all traffic, enable Cortex XDR to detect anomalous behavior from Cisco ASA firewall logs. For more information on setting up Log Forwarding on Cisco ASA firewalls, see the Cisco ASA Series documentation.


#### Ingest Logs from Fortinet Fortigate Firewalls
If use Fortinet Fortigate firewalls, still take advantage of Cortex XDR investigation and detection capabilities by forwarding firewall logs to Cortex XDR. This enables Cortex XDR to examine network traffic to detect anomalous behavior. Cortex XDR can use Fortinet Fortigate firewall logs as the sole data source, but can also use Fortinet Fortigate firewall logs in conjunction with Palo Alto Networks firewall logs. For additional endpoint context, also use Cortex XDR to collect and alert on endpoint data

 As an estimate for initial sizing, note that the average Fortinet Fortigate log size is roughly 1,070 bytes. For proper sizing calculations, test the log sizes and log rates produced by Fortinet Fortigate firewalls.
As soon as Cortex XDR starts to receive logs, the app can begin analyzing and raising Analytics alerts. Cortex XDR stores Analytics alerts according to Cortex Data Lake storage retention policy but does not store the Fortinet Fortigate firewall logs. As a result,not query or apply IOC and BIOC rule matching to Fortinet Fortigate firewall logs.
To integrate logs, first need to set up an applet in a broker VM within network to act as a syslog collector. then configure forwarding on log devices to send logs to the syslog collector.
- STEP 1 | Activate the Syslog Collector.
- STEP 2 | Configure the log device that receives Fortinet Fortigate firewall logs to forward syslog events
to the syslog collector.
Configure firewall policy to log all traffic and forward the traffic logs to the syslog collector. By logging all traffic, enable Cortex XDR to detect anomalous behavior from Fortinet Fortigate firewall logs. For more information on setting up Log Forwarding on Fortinet Fortigate firewalls, see the Fortinet FortiOS documentation.


#### Ingest Authentication Logs and Data
Ingesting Authentication Logs and Data requires a Cortex XDR Pro per TB license.
When ingest authentication logs and data from an external source, Cortex XDR can weave that information into authentication stories. An authentication story unites logs and data regardless of the information source (for example, from an on-premise KDC or from a cloud-based authentication service) into a uniform schema. To search authentication stories, use the Query Builder or Native Search.
Cortex XDR can ingest authentication logs and data from the following authentication services:
- Microsoft Azure AD
- Okta
- PingOne
Ingest Authentication Logs and Data from Azure AD
Ingesting Authentication Logs and Data from Azure AD requires a Cortex XDR Pro per TB license and a Microsoft Azure Premium 1 or Premium 2 license.
To receive authentication logs and data from Azure AD, must first configure the SaaS Log Collection settings in Cortex XDR. After set up log collection, Cortex XDR immediately begins receiving new authentication logs and data from the source. These logs and data are then searchable in Cortex XDR.
- STEP 1 | From the Microsoft Azure Console, create an app for Cortex XDR with the following API permissions: AuditLog.ReadAll and Directory.ReadAll. For more information on Microsoft Azure, see the following instructions on the Microsoft documentation portal:
- Register an app: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart- register-app

### Configure XDR
Before begin using Cortex XDR, must set up alert sensors. The more sensors that integrate with Cortex XDR, the more context have when a threat is detected. also set up Cortex XDR to raise Analytics alerts on network or endpoint data (or both) depending or Cortex XDR Pro licenses.
The following workflow highlights the tasks that must perform (in order) to configure Cortex XDR.
- STEP 1 | Integrate External Threat Intelligence Services.
Integrating external threat intelligence services enables to view feeds from sources such as
AutoFocus and VirusTotal in the context of incident investigation.
- STEP 2 | After activate Cortex XDR apps and services, wait 24 hours and then configure the Cortex XDR analytics.
1. Specify the internal networks that want Cortex XDR to monitor.
1. Log in to Cortex XDR app either using the direct link or from the Cortex XDR tile on the hub.
2. To view existing network segments, select the gear (   ) in the upper right corner and select Analytics Management > Status > Analytics Network Coverage Status. This page provides a table of the IP address ranges Cortex XDR Analytics monitors, which is pre-populated with the default IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces.
3. To add custom network segments, select Configuration and then Network Segments Configuration.
4. Add (   ) a new segment and enter the first and last IP address of the range to monitor.
5. Specify the Assigned Pathfinder VM to assign a Pathfinder VM to the network segment. If do
not want Pathfinder to scan a particular segment, then leave the field blank.
6. (Optional) If want to further limit Pathfinder scans to specific devices, go to the Pathfinder
page and then select Per Asset Configuration. Use these settings to override the default
Pathfinder configuration on a per-asset basis.
7. Leave Reserved for VPN blank.
8. Save (   ) the network segment. If the Configuration saved notification does not appear, save
again.
2. (Recommended) If want to use Pathfinder to supplement the Cortex XDR agent, Set Up
Pathfinder.
3. Activate Cortex XDR - Analytics.
By default, Cortex XDR - Analytics is disabled. Activating Cortex XDR - Analytics enables the Cortex XDR analytics engine to analyze endpoint data to develop a baseline and raise Analytics and Analytics BIOC alerts when anomalies and malicious behaviors are detected. To create a baseline, Cortex XDR requires a minimum set of data. To satisfy the requirement must have either
EDR logs from a minimum of 30 endpoints or 675MB of network traffic logs from Palo Alto Networks firewalls in the last 24 hours.
1. In Cortex XDR, select the gear (   ) in the upper right corner and then select Settings > Cortex XDR - Analytics.
The Enable option will be grayed out if do not have the required data set

  2. When available, Enable Cortex XDR - Analytics. The analytics engine will immediately begin analyzing Cortex data for anomalies.
- STEP 3 | Add an Alert Exclusion Policy.
- STEP 4 | Create an Incident Starring Configuration.
- STEP 5 | (Optional) Palo Alto Networks also automatically delivers behavioral indicators of compromise (BIOCs) rules defined by the Palo Alto Networks threat research team to all Cortex XDR tenants, but also import any additional indicators as rules, as needed.
To alert on specific BIOCs, Create a BIOC Rule. To immediately being alerting on known malicious indicators of compromise (IOCs)—such as known malicious IP addresses—Create an IOC Rule.


#### Integrate External Threat Intelligence Services
To aid with threat investigation, Cortex XDR displays the WildFire-issued verdict for each Key Artifact in an incident. To provide additional verification sources, integrate an external threat intelligence service with Cortex XDR. The threat intelligence services the app supports are:
- AutoFocusTM—AutoFocus groups conditions and indicators related to a threat with a tag. Tags can
be user-defined or come from threat-research team publications and are divided into classes, such as exploit, malware family, and malicious behavior. When add the service, the relevant tags display in the incident details page under Key Artifacts. Without an AutoFocus license key, still pivot from Cortex XDR to the service to initiate a query for the artifact. See the AutoFocus Administrator’s Guide for more information on AutoFocus tags.
- VirusTotal—VirusTotal provides aggregated results from over 70 antivirus scanners, domain services included in the block list, and user contributions. The VirusTotal score is represented as a fraction, where, for example, a score of 34/52 means out of 52 queried services, 34 services determined the artifact to be malicious. When add the service, the relevant VirusTotal score displays in the incident details page under Key Artifacts. Without a VirusTotal license key, still pivot from Cortex XDR to the service to initiate a query for the artifact.
- WildFire®—WildFire detects known and unknown threats, such as malware. The WildFire verdict contains detailed insights into the behavior of identified threats. The WildFire verdict displays next to

 relevant Key Artifacts in the incidents details page, the causality view, and within the Live Terminal view of processes.
WildFire provides verdicts and analysis reports to Cortex XDR users without requiring a license key. Using WildFire for next-generation firewalls or other use-cases continues to require an active license.
Before view external threat intelligence in Cortex XDR incidents, must obtain the license key for the service and add it to the Cortex XDR Configuration. After integrate any services, will see the verdict or verdict score when Investigate Incidents.

- Manage Columns and Rows

#### Manage Tables
Most pages in Cortex XDR present data in table format and provide controls to help manage and filter the results. If additional views or actions are available for a specific value, pivot (right-click) from the value in the table. For example, view the incident details, or pivot to the Causality View for an alert or pivot to the results for a query.
     Hub
  On most pages, also refresh (   ) the content on the page. To manage tables in the app:
- Filter Page Results
- Export Results to File
- Save and Share Filters
- Show or Hide Results

 - Manage Columns and Rows Filter Page Results
To reduce the number of results, filter by any heading and value. When apply a filter, Cortex XDR displays the filter criteria above the results table. also filter individual columns for specific values using the icon to the right of the column heading.
Some fields also support additional operators such as =, !=, Contains, not Contains, *, !*. There are three ways filter results:
- By column using the filter next to a field heading
- By building a filter query for one or more fields using the filter builder
- By pivoting from the contents of a cell (show or hide rows containing)
Filters are persistent. When navigate away from the page and return, any filter added remain active.
To build a filter using one or more fields:
- STEP 1 | From a Cortex XDR page, select Filter.
Cortex XDR adds the filter criteria above the top of the table. For example, on the filter page:
- STEP 2 | For each field want to filter:
1. Select or search the field.
2. Select the operator by which to match the criteria.
In most cases this will be = to include results that match the value specify, or != to exclude results
that match the value.
3. Enter a value to complete the filter criteria.
CMD fields have a 128 character limit. Shorten longer query strings to 127 characters and add an asterisk `(*)`.
Alternatively, select Include empty values to create a filter that excludes or includes results when the field has an empty values.
- STEP 3 | To add additional filters, click +AND (within the filter brackets) to display results that must match all specified criteria, or +OR to display results that match any of the criteria.
- STEP 4 | Click out of the filter area into the results table to see the results. STEP 5 | Next steps:

 - If at any time want to remove the filter, click the X next to it. To remove all filters, click the trash icon.
- Save and Share Filters. Export Results to File
If needed, export the page results for most pages in Cortex XDR to a tab separated values (TSV) file.
- STEP 1 | (Optional) Filter Page Results to reduce the number of results for export. STEP 2 | To the left of the refresh icon (   ), Export to file.
Cortex XDR exports any results matching applied filters in TSV format. The TSV format requires a tab separator, automatic detection does not work in case of multi-event exports.
Save and Share Filters save and share filters across organization.
- Save a filter:
Saved filters are listed on the Filters tab for the table layout and filter manager menu.
1. Save (   ) the active filter.
2. Enter a name to identify the filter. create multiple filters with the same name. Saving a filter with an existing name will not
override the existing filter.
3. Choose whether to Share this filter or whether to keep it private for own use only.
- Share a filter: share a filter across organization.
1. Select the table layout and filter menu indicated by the three vertical dots, then select Filters.
 2. Select the filter to share and click the share icon.
3. If needed, later unshare (
Unsharing a filter will turn a public filter private. Deleting a shared filter will remove it for all users.
Show or Hide Results
As an alternative to building a filter query from scratch or using the column filters, pivot from rows and specific values to define the match criteria to fine tune the results in the table. also pivot on

 empty values to show only results with empty values or only results that do not have empty values in the column from which pivot.
CMD fields are limited to 128 characters. If pivot on a CMD field with a truncated value, the app shows or hides all results that match the first 128 characters.
The show or hide action is a temporary means of filtering the results: If navigate away from the page and later return, any results previously hid will appear again.
This option is available for fields which have a finite list of options. To hide or show only results that match a specific field value:
- STEP 1 | Right-click the matching field value by which want to hide or show. STEP 2 | Select the desired action:
- Hide rows with <field value> - Show rows with <field value>
- Hide empty rows
- Show empty rows
Manage Columns and Rows
From Cortex XDR pages, manage how want to view the results table and what information want XDR app to display.
- Adjust the row height
- Adjust the column width
- Add or remove fields in the table
Any adjustments make to the columns or rows persist when navigate away from and later return to the page.
- Adjust the row height:
1. On the Cortex XDR page select the menu indicated by three vertical dots to the right of the Filter button.

#### About Cortex XDR Endpoint Protection
Cyberattacks are attacks performed on networks or endpoints to inflict damage, steal information, or achieve other goals that involve taking control of computer systems that do not belong to the attackers. These adversaries perpetrate cyberattacks either by causing a user to unintentionally run a malicious executable file, known as malware, or by exploiting a weakness in a legitimate executable file to run malicious code behind the scenes without the knowledge of the user.
One way to prevent these attacks is to identify executable files, dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), and other pieces of code to determine if they are malicious and, if so, to prevent them from executing by testing each potentially dangerous code module against a list of specific, known threat signatures. The weakness of this method is that it is time-consuming for signature-based antivirus (AV) solutions to identify newly created threats that are known only to the attacker (also known as zero-day attacks or exploits) and add them to the lists of known threats, which leaves endpoints vulnerable until signatures are updated.
Cortex XDR takes a more efficient and effective approach to preventing attacks that eliminates the need for traditional AV. Rather than try to keep up with the ever-growing list of known threats, Cortex XDR sets up a series of roadblocks—traps, if will—that prevent the attacks at their initial entry points—the point where legitimate executable files are about to unknowingly allow malicious access to the system.
Cortex XDR provides a multi-method protection solution with exploit protection modules that target software vulnerabilities in processes that open non-executable files and malware protection modules that examine executable files, DLLs, and macros for malicious signatures and behavior. Using this multi-method approach, the Cortex XDR solution can prevent all types of attacks, whether they are known or unknown threats.


#### Exploit Protection Overview
An exploit is a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in a software application or process. Attackers use these exploits to access and use a system to their advantage. To gain control of a system, the attacker must exploit a chain of vulnerabilities in the system. Blocking any attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the chain will block the entire exploitation attempt.
To combat an attack in which an attacker takes advantage of a software exploit or vulnerability, Cortex XDR employs exploit protection modules (EPMs). Each EPM targets a specific type of exploit attack in the attack chain. Some capabilities that Cortex XDR EPMs provide are reconnaissance prevention, memory corruption prevention, code execution prevention, and kernel protection.

#### Malware Protection Overview
Malicious files, known as malware, are often disguised as or embedded in non-malicious files. These files can attempt to gain control, gather sensitive information, or disrupt the normal operations of the system. Cortex XDR prevents malware by employing the Malware Prevention Engine. This approach combines several layers of protection to prevent both known and unknown malware that has not been seen before from causing harm to endpoints. The mitigation techniques that the Malware Prevention Engine employs vary by the endpoint type:
- Malware Protection for Windows
- Malware Protection for Mac
- Malware Protection for Linux
- Malware Protection for Android
Malware Protection for Windows
- WildFire integration—Enables automatic detection of known malware and analysis of unknown malware using WildFire threat intelligence.

 - Local static analysis—Enables Cortex XDR to use machine learning to analyze unknown files and issue a verdict. Cortex XDR uses the verdict returned by the local analysis module until it receives a verdict from Cortex XDR.
- DLL file protection—Enables Cortex XDR to block known and unknown DLLs on Windows endpoints.
- Office file protection—Enables Cortex XDR to block known and unknown macros when run from
Microsoft Office files on Windows endpoints.
- PDF file protection—Enables Cortex XDR to block known and unknown PDFs when run on Windows
endpoints.
- Behavioral threat protection (Windows 7 SP1 and later versions)—Enables continuous monitoring of endpoint activity to identify and analyze chains of events—known as causality chains. This enables Cortex XDR to detect malicious activity that could otherwise appear legitimate if inspected as individual events. Behavioral threat protection requires Traps agent 6.0 or a later release.
- Evaluation of trusted signers—Permits unknown files that are signed by highly trusted signers to run on the endpoint.
- Malware protection modules—Targets behaviors—such as those associated with ransomware—and enables to block the creation of child processes.
- Policy-based restrictions—Enables to block files from executing from within specific local folders, network folders, or external media locations.
- Periodic and automated scanning—Enables to block dormant malware that has not yet tried to execute on endpoints.
Malware Protection for Mac
- WildFire integration—Enables automatic detection of known malware and analysis of unknown malware using WildFire threat intelligence.
- Local static analysis—Enables Cortex XDR to use machine learning to analyze unknown files and issue a verdict. The Cortex XDR agent uses the verdict returned by the local analysis module until it receives the WildFire verdict from Cortex XDR.
- Behavioral threat protection—Enables continuous monitoring of endpoint activity to identify and analyze chains of events—known as causality chains. This enables the Cortex XDR agent to detect malicious activity that could otherwise appear legitimate if inspected as individual events. Behavioral threat protection requires Traps agent 6.1 or a later release.
- Mach-O file protection—Enables to block known malicious and unknown mach-o files on Mac endpoints.
- DMG file protection—Enables to block known malicious and unknown DMG files on Mac endpoints.
- Evaluation of trusted signers—Permits unknown files that are signed by trusted signers to run on the
endpoint.
- Periodic and automated scanning—Enables to block dormant malware that has not yet tried to
execute on endpoints. Scanning requires Cortex XDR agent 7.1 or a later release.

Malware Protection for Linux
- WildFire integration—Enables automatic detection of known malware and analysis of unknown malware using WildFire threat intelligence. WildFire integration requires Traps agent 6.0 or a later release.
- Local static analysis—Enables the Cortex XDR agent to use machine learning to analyze unknown files and issue a verdict. The Cortex XDR agent uses the verdict returned by the local analysis module until it receives the WildFire verdict from Cortex XDR. Local analysis requires Traps agent 6.0 or a later release.
- Behavioral threat protection—Enables continuous monitoring of endpoint activity to identify and analyze chains of events—known as causality chains. This enables Cortex XDR to detect malicious activity that could otherwise appear legitimate if inspected as individual events. Behavioral threat protection requires Traps agent 6.1 or a later release.
- ELF file protection—Enables to block known malicious and unknown ELF files executed on a host server or within a container on a Cortex XDR-protected endpoint. Cortex XDR automatically suspends the file execution until a WildFire or local analysis verdict is obtained. ELF file protection requires Traps agent 6.0 or a later release.

 - Malware protection modules—Targets the execution behavior of a file—such as those associated with reverse shell protection.
Malware Protection for Android
- WildFire integration—Enables automatic detection of known malware and grayware, and analysis of unknown APK files using WildFire threat intelligence.
- APK files examination—Analyze and prevent malicious APK files from running.
- Evaluation of trusted signers—Permits unknown files that are signed by trusted signers to run on the
Android device.

#### File Analysis and Protection Flow
The Cortex XDR agent utilizes advanced multi-method protection and prevention techniques to protect endpoints from both known and unknown malware and software exploits.
Exploit Protection for Protected Processes
In a typical attack scenario, an attacker attempts to gain control of a system by first corrupting or bypassing memory allocation or handlers. Using memory-corruption techniques, such as buffer overflows and heap corruption, a hacker can trigger a bug in software or exploit a vulnerability in a process. The attacker must then manipulate a program to run code provided or specified by the attacker while evading detection. If the attacker gains access to the operating system, the attacker can then upload malware, such as Trojan horses (programs that contain malicious executable files), or can otherwise use the system to their advantage. The Cortex XDR agent prevents such exploit attempts by employing roadblocks—or traps—at each stage of an exploitation attempt.
When a user opens a non-executable file, such as a PDF or Word document, and the process that opened the file is protected, the Cortex XDR agent seamlessly injects code into the software. This occurs at the earliest possible stage before any files belonging to the process are loaded into memory. The Cortex XDR agent then activates one or more protection modules inside the protected process. Each protection module targets a specific exploitation technique and is designed to prevent attacks on program vulnerabilities based on memory corruption or logic flaws.
In addition to automatically protecting processes from such attacks, the Cortex XDR agent reports any security events to Cortex XDR and performs additional actions as defined in the endpoint security policy. Common actions that the Cortex XDR agent performs include collecting forensic data and notifying the user about the event.

 The default endpoint security policy protects the most vulnerable and most commonly used applications but also add other third-party and proprietary applications to the list of protected processes.
Malware Protection
The Cortex XDR agent provides malware protection in a series of four evaluation phases:
Phase 1: Evaluation of Child Process Protection Policy
When a user attempts to run an executable, the operating system attempts to run the executable as a process. If the process tries to launch any child processes, the Cortex XDR agent first evaluates the child process protection policy. If the parent process is a known targeted process that attempts to launch a restricted child process, the Cortex XDR agent blocks the child processes from running and reports the security event to Cortex XDR. For example, if a user tries to open a Microsoft Word document (using the winword.exe process) and that document has a macro that tries to run a blocked child process (such as WScript), the Cortex XDR agent blocks the child process and reports the event to Cortex XDR. If the parent process does not try to launch any child processes or tries to launch a child process that is not restricted, the Cortex XDR agent next moves to Phase 2: Evaluation of the Restriction Policy.
Phase 2: Evaluation of the Restriction Policy
When a user or machine attempts to open an executable file, the Cortex XDR agent first evaluates the child process protection policy as described in Phase 1: Evaluation of Child Process Protection Policy. The Cortex XDR agent next verifies that the executable file does not violate any restriction rules. For example, might have a restriction rule that blocks executable files launched from network locations. If a restriction rule applies to an executable file, the Cortex XDR agent blocks the file from executing and reports the security event to Cortex XDR and, depending on the configuration of each restriction rule, the Cortex XDR agent can also notify the user about the prevention event.
If no restriction rules apply to an executable file, the Cortex XDR agent next moves to Phase 3: Evaluation of Hash Verdicts.
Phase 3: Hash Verdict Determination
The Cortex XDR agent calculates a unique hash using the SHA-256 algorithm for every file that attempts to run on the endpoint. Depending on the features that enable, the Cortex XDR agent performs additional

 analysis to determine whether an unknown file is malicious or benign. The Cortex XDR agent can also submit unknown files to Cortex XDR for in-depth analysis by WildFire.
To determine a verdict for a file, the Cortex XDR agent evaluates the file in the following order:
1. Hash exception—A hash exception enables to override the verdict for a specific file without affecting the settings in Malware Security profile. The hash exception policy is evaluated first and takes precedence over all other methods to determine the hash verdict.
For example, may want to configure a hash exception for any of the following situations:
- want to block a file that has a benign verdict.
- want to allow a file that has a malware verdict to run. In general, we recommend that you
only override the verdict for malware after use available threat intelligence resources—such as
WildFire and AutoFocus—to determine that the file is not malicious.
- want to specify a verdict for a file that has not yet received an official WildFire verdict.
After configure a hash exception, Cortex XDR distributes it at the next heartbeat communication with any endpoints that have previously opened the file.
When a file launches on the endpoint, the Cortex XDR agent first evaluates any relevant hash exception for the file. The hash exception specifies whether to treat the file as malware. If the file is assigned a benign verdict, the Cortex XDR agent permits it to open.
If a hash exception is not configured for the file, the Cortex XDR agent next evaluates the verdict to determine the likelihood of malware. The Cortex XDR agent uses a multi-step evaluation process in the following order to determine the verdict: Highly trusted signers, WildFire verdict, and then Local analysis.
2. Highly trusted signers (Windows and Mac)—The Cortex XDR agent distinguishes highly trusted signers such as Microsoft from other known signers. To keep parity with the signers defined in WildFire, Palo Alto Networks regularly reviews the list of highly trusted and known signers and delivers any changes with content updates. The list of highly trusted signers also includes signers that are included the
allow list from Cortex XDR. When an unknown file attempts to run, the Cortex XDR agent applies the following evaluation criteria: Files signed by highly trusted signers are permitted to run and files signed by prevented signers are blocked, regardless of the WildFire verdict. Otherwise, when a file is not signed by a highly trusted signer or by a signer included in the block list, the Cortex XDR agent next evaluates the WildFire verdict. For Windows endpoints, evaluation of other known signers takes place if WildFire evaluation returns an unknown verdict for the file.
3. WildFire verdict—If a file is not signed by a highly trusted signer on Windows and Mac endpoints, the Cortex XDR agent performs a hash verdict lookup to determine if a verdict already exists in its local cache.
If the executable file has a malware verdict, the Cortex XDR agent reports the security event to the Cortex XDR and, depending on the configured behavior for malicious files, the Cortex XDR agent then does one of the following:
- Blocks the malicious executable file
- Blocks and quarantines the malicious executable file
- Notifies the user about the file but still allows the file to execute
- Logs the issue without notifying the user and allows the file to execute.
If the verdict is benign, the Cortex XDR agent moves on to the next stage of evaluation (see Phase 4: Evaluation of Malware Protection Policy).
If the hash does not exist in the local cache or has an unknown verdict, the Cortex XDR agent next
evaluates whether the file is signed by a known signer.
4. Local analysis—When an unknown executable, DLL, or macro attempts to run on a Windows or
Mac endpoint, the Cortex XDR agent uses local analysis to determine if it is likely to be malware. On Windows endpoints, if the file is signed by a known signer, the Cortex XDR agent permits the file to

 run and does not perform additional analysis. For files on Mac endpoints and files that are not signed by a known signer on Windows endpoints, the Cortex XDR agent performs local analysis to determine whether the file is malware. Local analysis uses a statistical model that was developed with machine learning on WildFire threat intelligence. The model enables the Cortex XDR agent to examine hundreds of characteristics for a file and issue a local verdict (benign or malicious) while the endpoint is offline or Cortex XDR is unreachable. The Cortex XDR agent can rely on the local analysis verdict until it receives an official WildFire verdict or hash exception.
Local analysis is enabled by default in a Malware Security profile. Because local analysis always returns a verdict for an unknown file, if enable the Cortex XDR agent to Block files with unknown verdict, the agent only blocks unknown files if a local analysis error occurs or local analysis is disabled. To change the default settings (not recommended), see Add a New Malware Security Profile.
Phase 4: Evaluation of Malware Security Policy
If the prior evaluation phases do not identify a file as malware, the Cortex XDR agent observes the behavior of the file and applies additional malware protection rules. If a file exhibits malicious behavior, such as encryption-based activity common with ransomware, the Cortex XDR agent blocks the file and reports the security event to the Cortex XDR.
If no malicious behavior is detected, the Cortex XDR agent permits the file (process) to continue running but continues to monitor the behavior for the lifetime of the process.

#### Endpoint Protection Modules
Each security profile applies multiple security modules to protect endpoints from a wide range of attack techniques. While the settings for each module are not configurable, the Cortex XDR agent activates a specific protection module depending on the type of attack, the configuration of security policy, and the operating system of the endpoint. When a security event occurs, the Cortex XDR agent logs details about the event including the security module employed by the Cortex XDR agent to detect and prevent the attack based on the technique. To help understand the nature of the attack, the alert identifies the protection module the Cortex XDR agent employed.
The following table lists the modules and the platforms on which they are supported. A dash (—) indicates the module is not supported.

### Manage Cortex XDR Agents
- Create an Agent Installation Package
- Set an Application Proxy for Cortex XDR Agents
- Move Cortex XDR Agents Between Managing XDR Servers
- Upgrade Cortex XDR Agents
- Delete Cortex XDR Agents
- Uninstall the Cortex XDR Agent

#### Create an Agent Installation Package

To install the Cortex XDR agent on the endpoint for the first time,
1. create an agent installation package.
2. download an installation package
3. install it directly on an endpoint or use a software deployment tool of choice to distribute the software to multiple endpoints.
   - To install the Cortex XDR agent, must use a valid installation package that exists in Cortex XDR management console.
   - If delete an installation package, any agents installed from this package are not able to register to Cortex XDR.
4. After install, upgrade individual or batches of agents remotely from the Cortex XDR management console.


To create a new installation package:
- STEP 1 | `XDR > Endpoints > Endpoint Management > Agent Installations`.
- STEP 2 | **Create** a new installation package.
- STEP 3 | Enter a unique **Name** and an optional **Description** to identify the installation package.
  - The package Name must be no more than 32 characters but can contain letters, numbers, or spaces.
- STEP 4 | Select the **Package Type**.
  - <kbd>Standalone Installers</kbd> — Use for fresh installations and to Upgrade Cortex XDR Agents on a registered endpoint that is connected to Cortex XDR.
  - (Windows, macOS, and Linux only) <kbd>Upgrade from ESM</kbd> — Use this package to upgrade `Traps agents` which connect to the on-premise `Traps Endpoint Security Manager` to Cortex XDR.

- STEP 5 | Select the **Platform** (Windows, macOS, and Linux only)
- STEP 6 | Select the Agent Version for the package.
- STEP 7 | Create the installation package.
- STEP 8 | Download installation package.
  - For Windows endpoints, select between the architecture type.
  - For macOS endpoints, download the ZIP installation folder and upload it to the endpoint. To deploy the Cortex XDR agent using JAMF, upload the ZIP folder to JAMF. Alternatively, to install the agent
  manually on the endpoint, unzip the ZIP folder and double-click the pkg file.
  - For Linux endpoints, download .rpm or .deb installers (according to the endpoint
  Linux distribution), and deploy the installers on the endpoints using the Linux package manager. Alternatively, download a Shell installer and deploy it manually on the endpoint.
  - For Android endpoints, Cortex XDR creates a tenant-specific download link which distribute to Android endpoints. When a newer agent version is available, Cortex XDR identifies older package versions as [Outdated].

> When upgrade a Cortex XDR agent version without package manager, Cortex XDR will upgrade the installation process to package manager by default, according to the endpoint Linux distribution.

- STEP 9 | `Agent Installations page`: manage agent installation packages.
  - To manage a specific package, right click the agent version, and select the desired action:
  - Edit
  - Delete the installation package. Deleting an installation package does not uninstall the Cortex XDR agent software from any endpoints. However, if install the Cortex XDR agent from a package after delete it, Cortex XDR denies the registration request leaving the agent in an unprotected state. If this is undesirable, instead hide the installation package from the main view of the Agent Installations page. Hiding a package can be useful to filter earlier or less relevant versions from the main view.
  - Hide installation packages. Using the Hide option provides a quick method to filter out results based on a specific value in the table. also use the filters at the top of the page to build a filter from scratch. To create a persistent filter, save ( ) it.


#### Set an Application Proxy for Cortex XDR Agents
This capability is supported on endpoints with Traps agent 5.0.9 (Windows only) or Cortex XDR agent 7.0 and later releases.
In environments where agents communicate with the Cortex XDR server through a wide-system proxy, now set an application-specific proxy for the Traps and Cortex XDR agent without affecting the communication of other applications on the endpoint. set the proxy in one of three ways: during the agent installation or after installation using Cytool on the endpoint or from Endpoints Management in Cortex XDR as described in this topic. assign up to five different proxy servers per agent. The proxy server the agent uses is selected randomly and with equal probability. If the communication between the agent and the Cortex XDR sever through the app-specific proxies fails, the agent resumes communication through the system-wide proxy defined on the endpoint. If that fails as well, the agent resumes communication with Cortex XDR directly.
- STEP 1 | From Cortex XDR, select Endpoints > Endpoint Management > Endpoint Administration.
- STEP 2 | If needed, filter the list of endpoints.
- STEP 3 | Set an agent proxy.
1. Select the row of the endpoint for which want to set a proxy.
2. Right-click the endpoint and select Endpoint Control > Set Endpoint Proxy.
3. For each proxy, enter the IP address and port number. assign up to five different proxies per
agent.
4. Set when you’re done.
5. If necessary, later Disable Endpoint Proxy from the right-click menu.
When disable the proxy configuration, all proxies associated with that agent are removed. The agent resumes communication with the Cortex XDR sever through the wide-system proxy if defined, otherwise if a wide-system is not defined the agent resumes communicating directly with the Cortex XDR server. If neither a wide-system proxy nor direct communication exist and disable the proxy, the agent will disconnect from Cortex XDR.
Move Cortex XDR Agents Between Managing XDR Servers move existing agents between Cortex XDR managing servers directly from the Cortex XDR management console. This can be useful during POCs or to better manage agents allocation between tenants. When change the server that manages the agent, the agent transfers to the new managing server as a freshly installed agent, without any data that was previously stored for it on the original managing server. After the Cortex XDR registers with the new server, it can no longer communicate with the previous one.
The following are prerequisites to enable change the managing server of a Cortex XDR agent:

 - Ensure that are running a Cortex XDR agent 7.2 or later release.
- Ensure have administrator privileges for Cortex XDR in the hub.
To register to another managing server, the Cortex XDR agent requires a distribution ID of an installation package on the target server in order to identify itself as a valid Cortex XDR agent. The agent must provide an ID of an installation package that matches the same operating system and for the same or a previous agent version. For example, if want to move a Cortex XDR Agent 7.0.2 for Windows, select from the target managing server the ID of an installation package created for a Cortex XDR Agent 5.0.0 for Windows. The operating system version can be different.
To change the managing server of a Cortex XDR Agent:
- STEP 1 | Obtain an installation package ID from the target managing server.
1. Log in to Cortex XDR on the target management server, then navigate to Endpoints > Endpoint Management > Agent Installations.
2. From the agent installations table, locate a valid installation package use to register the agent. Alternatively, create a new installation package if required.
3. Right-click the ID field and copy the value. Save this value, will need it later for the registration process. If the ID column is not displayed in the table, add it.
- STEP 2 | Locate the Cortex XDR agent want to move.
Log in the current managing server of the Cortex XDR agent and navigate to Endpoints > Endpoint
Management > Endpoints Administration.
- STEP 3 | Change the managing server.
1. Select one or more agents that want to move to the target server.
2. Right click + Alt to open the options menu in advanced mode, and select Endpoint Control > Change
managing server. This option is available only for an administrator in Cortex XDR and for Cortex XDR agent 7.2 and later releases.
3. Enter the ID number of the installation package obtained in Step 1. If selected agents running on different operating systems, for example Windows and Linux, must provide an ID for each operating system. When done, click Move.


  STEP 4 | Track the action.
When track the action in the Action Center, the original managing server will keep displaying In progress (Sent) status also after the action has ended successfully, since the agent no longer reports to this managing server. The new managing server will add this as a new agent registration action.


#### Upgrade Cortex XDR Agents
After install the Cortex XDR agent and the agent registers with Cortex XDR, upgrade the Cortex XDR agent software using a method supported by the endpoint platform:
- Android—Upgrade the app directly from the Google Play Store or push the app to endpoints from an endpoint management system such as AirWatch.
- Windows, Mac, or Linux—Create new installation packages and push the Cortex XDR agent package to up to 5,000 endpoints from Cortex XDR.not upgrade VDI endpoints. Additionally,not upgrade a Golden Image from Cortex XDR agent 6.1.x or an earlier release to a Cortex XDR agent 7.1.0 or a later release.
Upgrades are supported using actions which initiate from the Action Center or from Endpoint Administration as described in this workflow.
- STEP 1 | Create an Agent Installation Package for each operating system version for which want to upgrade the Cortex XDR agent.
Note the installation package names.
- STEP 2 | Select Endpoints > Endpoint Management.
If needed, filter the list of endpoints. To reduce the number of results, use the endpoint name search and
filters Filters at the top of the page.
- STEP 3 | Select the endpoints want to upgrade. also select endpoints running different operating systems to upgrade the agents at the same time.
- STEP 4 | Right-click selection and select Endpoint Control > Upgrade agent version.

  For each platform, select the name of the installation package want to push to the selected endpoints.
Starting in the Cortex XDR agent 7.1 release, install the Cortex XDR agent on Linux endpoints using package manager. When upgrade an agent on a Linux endpoint that is not using package manager, Cortex XDR upgrades the installation process by default according to the endpoint Linux distribution. Alternatively, if do not want to use the package manage, clear the option Upgrade to installation by package manager.
The Cortex XDR agent keeps the name of the original installation package after every upgrade.
- STEP 5 | Upgrade.

 Cortex XDR distributes the installation package to the selected endpoints at the next heartbeat communication with the agent. To monitor the status of the upgrades, go to Response > Action Center. From the Action Center also view additional information about the upgrade (right-click the action and select Additional data) or cancel the upgrade (right-click the action and select Cancel Agent Upgrade).
- During the upgrade process, the endpoint operating system might request for a reboot. However, do not have to perform the reboot for the Cortex XDR agent upgrade process to complete successfully.
- After upgrade to a Cortex XDR agent 7.2 or a later release on an endpoint with Cortex XDR Device Control rules, need to reboot the endpoint for the rules to take effect.



### Delete Cortex XDR Agents

Deleting an endpoint triggers the following lifespan flow:
- Standard agents are deleted after 180 days of inactivity.
- VDI and TS agents are deleted after 6 hours of inactivity.

> To reinstate an endpoint, have to uninstall and reinstall the endpoint.


After an endpoint is deleted, data associated with the deleted endpoint is displayed in the Action Center tables and in the Causality View with am `Endpoint Name - N/A (Endpoint Deleted)`.

Alerts that already include the endpoint data at the time of the alert creation are not affected.

to delete the Cortex XDR agent
- STEP 1 | `Endpoints > Endpoint Management > Endpoint Administration`.
- STEP 2 | `Right-click > Endpoint Control > Delete Endpoint`.



#### Uninstall the Cortex XDR Agent

To uninstall the Cortex XDR app
- STEP 1 | XDR > Response > Action Center > + New Action.
- STEP 2 | Select `Agent Uninstall`.
- STEP 3 | Click Next.
- STEP 4 | Select the target endpoints (up to 100) for which want to uninstall the Cortex XDR agent.
- STEP 5 | Click Next.
- STEP 6 | Review the action summary and click Done when finished.
- STEP 7 | To track the status of the uninstallation, return to the Action Center.

### install the agent


#### Install the Cortex XDR Agent 7.1 Using Msiexec


When you install the Cortex XDR agent with Msiexec, you must install the Cortex XDR agent per-machine and not per-user.

Although Msiexec supports additional options, the Cortex XDR agent installers support only the options listed here.

For example, with Msiexec, the option to install the software in a non-standard directory is not supported—you must use the default path.

command | note
---|---
`/i<installpath>\<installerfilename>.msi` | Install a package. <br> example: `msiexec /i c:\install\cortexxdr.msi`
`/qn` | Displays no user interface (quiet installation).
`/L*v <logpath>\<logfilename>.txt` | Log verbose output to a file. <br> example: `/l*v c:\logs\install.txt`
`VDI_ENABLED=1` | to install the agent on the golden image for a **non-persistent VDI**. <br> This option identifies the session as a VDI in Cortex XDR and applies license and endpoint management policy specific for non-persistent VDI.
`TS_ENABLED=1` | to install the agent on the golden image for a **temporary session**. <br> This option identifies the session as a temporary session in XDR and to apply license and endpoint management policy specific for temporary sessions.
`proxy_list` | to install agents that communicate with Cortex XDR through an **application-specific proxy for Cortex XDR**. <br> This option is relevant in environments where XDR agents communicate with XDR through a proxy, enabling Cortex XDR admins to control and manage the agent proxy configuration settings without affecting the communication of other applications on the endpoint.
`RESTRICT_RESPONSE_ACTIONS=1` | permanently disable the option for Cortex XDR to perform all, or a combination, of the following actions on endpoints running a Cortex XDR agent: initiate a Live Terminal remote session on the endpoint, execute Python scripts on the endpoint, and retrieve files from the endpoint to Cortex XDR. <br> Disabling any of these actions is an irreversible action, so to enable the action again, must uninstall the Cortex XDR agent and install a new package without this flag. <br> To disable a specific action, use the corresponding flag: <br> `RESTRICT_LIVE_TERMINAL=1`: disable Live Terminal. <br> `RESTRICT_SCRIPT_EXECUTION=1`: disable script execution. <br> `RESTRICT_FILE_RETRIEVAL=1`: disable files retrieval.


To install Cortex XDR using Msiexec:
1. Windows endpoint, verify that the system meets the requirements described in Cortex XDR Agent for Windows Requirements.
2. open a command prompt as an administrator.
   - `Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command prompt > Run as administrator`
   - `Start > cmd. open the command prompt as an administrator, press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER`.
3. Run the msiexec command followed by one or more supported options and properties.
   - `msiexec /i c:\install\cortexxdr.msi /l*v C:\temp\cortexxdrinstall.log /qn`

After you complete the installation, verify the Cortex XDR agent can establish a connection.

> If the Cortex XDR agent does not connect to Cortex XDR, verify your internet connection and perform a check-in on the endpoint. If the agent still does not connect, verify the installation package has not been removed from the Cortex XDR management console.


#### Configure Cortex XDR Specific Proxy
In environments where Cortex XDR agents communicate with Cortex XDR through a proxy, you can define a system-wide proxy that affects all communication on the endpoint, or a Cortex XDR specific proxy that you can set, manage, and disable in Cortex XDR. This topic describes how to install a Cortex XDR agent on the endpoint and assign it a Cortex XDR specific proxy.
Install a Cortex XDR Agent Using Msiexec and include the proxy_list argument.
The argument format is proxy_list=”<proxy>:<port>”
To install a Cortex XDR agent with a Cortex XDR specific proxy, enter your proxy IP address and port number. You can assign up to five different IP addresses per agent, and the proxy for communication is selected randomly with equal probability.
For example:
msiexec /i c:\install\cortexxdr.msi proxy_list=”10.196.20.244:8080,10.196.20.245:8080”
To install a Cortex XDR agent communicating through the Palo Alto Networks Broker Service, you must enter the Broker VM IP address and port number 8888 only.
After the initial installation, you can change the proxy settings if necessary from the Endpoints page of Cortex XDR.

### Define Endpoint Groups
To easily apply policy rules to specific endpoints, define an endpoint group. There are two methods use to define an endpoint group:
- Create a dynamic group by allowing Cortex XDR to populate endpoint group dynamically using endpoint characteristics such as a partial hostname or alias; full or partial domain or workgroup name; IP address, range or subnet; installation type (VDI, temporary session, or standard endpoint); agent version; endpoint type (workstation, server, mobile); or operating system version.
- Create a static group by selecting a list of specific endpoints.
After define an endpoint group, then use it to target policy and actions to specific recipients. The Endpoint Groups page displays all endpoint groups along with the number of endpoints and policy rules linked to the endpoint group.
To define an endpoint static or dynamic group:
- STEP 1 | From Cortex XDR, select Endpoints > Endpoint Management > Endpoint Groups > +Add
Group.
- STEP 2 | Select either Create New to create an endpoint group from scratch or Upload From File, using plain text files with new line separator, to populate a static endpoint group from a file containing IP addresses, hostnames, or aliases.
- STEP 3 | Enter a Group Name and optional Description to identify the endpoint group. The name assign to the group will be visible when assign endpoint security profiles to endpoints.
- STEP 4 | Determine the endpoint properties for creating an endpoint group:
- Dynamic—Use the filters to define the criteria want to use to dynamically populate an endpoint group. Dynamic groups support multiple criteria selections and can use AND or OR operators. For endpoint names and aliases, and domains and workgroups, use * to match any string of characters. As apply filters, Cortex XDR displays any registered endpoint matches to help validate filter criteria.


   Cortex XDR supports only IPv4 addresses.
- Static—Select specific registered endpoints that want to include in the endpoint group. Use the filters, as needed, to reduce the number of results.
When create a static endpoint group from a file, the IP address, hostname, or alias of the endpoint must match an existing agent that has registered with Cortex XDR. select up to 250 endpoints.
When disconnect the Directory Sync Service (DSS) in Cortex XDR deployment, it might affect existing endpoint groups and policy rules based on Active Directory properties.


  STEP 5 | Create the endpoint group.
After save endpoint group, it is ready for use to assign security profiles to endpoints and in
other places where use endpoint groups.
- STEP 6 | Manage an endpoint group, as needed.
At any time, return to the Endpoint Groups page to view and manage endpoint groups. To
manage a group, right-click the group and select the desired action:
- Edit—View the endpoints that match the group definition, and optionally refine the membership criteria using filters.
- Delete the endpoint group.
- Save as new—Duplicate the endpoint group and save it as a new group.
- Export group—Export the list of endpoints that match the endpoint group criteria to a tab separated
values (TSV) file.


### About Content Updates
To increase security coverage and quickly resolve any issues in policy, Palo Alto Networks can seamlessly deliver software packages for Cortex XDR called content updates. Content updates can contain changes or updates to any of the following:
Starting with the Cortex XDR 7.1 agent release, Cortex XDR delivers to the agent the content update in parts and not as a single file, allowing the agent to retrieve only the updates and additions it needs.
- Default security policy including exploit, malware, restriction, and agent settings profiles
- Default compatibility rules per module
- Protected processes
- Local analysis logic
- Trusted signers
- Processes included in block list by signers
- Behavioral threat protection rules
- Ransomware module logic including Windows network folders susceptible to ransomware attacks
- Windows Event Logs
- Python scripts provided by Palo Alto Networks
- Python modules supported in script execution
- Maximum file size for hash calculations in File search and destroy
- List of common file types included in File search and destroy
When a new update is available, Cortex XDR notifies the Cortex XDR agent. The Cortex XDR agent then randomly chooses a time within a six-hour window during which it will retrieve the content update from Cortex XDR. By staggering the distribution of content updates, Cortex XDR reduces the bandwidth load and prevents bandwidth saturation due to the high volume and size of the content updates across many endpoints. view the distribution of endpoints by content update version from the Cortex XDR Dashboard.
To adjust content update distribution for environment, configure the following optional settings:
- Content distribution bandwidth as part of the Cortex XDR global agent configurations.
- Content download source, as part of the Cortex XDR agent setting profile.
Otherwise, if want the Cortex XDR agent to retrieve the latest content from the server immediately, force the Cortex XDR agent to connect to the server in one of the following methods:
- (Windows and Mac only) Perform manual check-in from the Cortex XDR agent console. - Initiate a check-in using the Cytool checkin command.

### Endpoint Security Profiles
Cortex XDR provides default security profiles that use out of the box to immediately begin protecting endpoints from threats. While security rules enable to block or allow files to run
on endpoints, security profiles help customize and reuse settings across different groups of endpoints. When the Cortex XDR agent detects behavior that matches a rule defined in security policy, the Cortex XDR agent applies the security profile that is attached to the rule for further inspection.
  Profile Name
    Description
     Exploit Profiles
   Exploit profiles block attempts to exploit system flaws in browsers, and in the operating system. For example, Exploit profiles help protect against exploit kits, illegal code execution, and other attempts to exploit process and system vulnerabilities. Exploit profiles are supported for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

of malware including trojans, viruses, worms,
and grayware. Malware profiles serve two main purposes: to define how to treat behavior common with malware, such as ransomware or script-based attacks, and to define how to treat known malware and unknown files. Malware profiles are supported for all platforms.
Add a New Malware Security Profile.
     Restrictions Profiles
     Restrictions profiles limit where executables can run on an endpoint. For example, restrict files from running from specific local folders or from removable media. Restrictions profiles are supported only for Windows platforms.
Add a New Restrictions Security Profile.
     Agent Settings Profiles
   Agent Settings profiles enable to customize settings that apply to the Cortex XDR agent (such as the disk space quota for log retention). For Mac and Windows platforms, also customize user interface options for the Cortex XDR console, such as accessibility and notifications.
Add a New Agent Settings Profile.
      Exceptions Profiles

Exceptions Security Profiles override the security policy to allow a process or file to run on an endpoint, to disable a specific BTP rule, to allow a known digital signer, and to import exceptions from the Cortex XDR support team. Exceptions

   Profile Name
   Description
     profiles are supported for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.
Add a New Exceptions Security Profile.
  After add the new security profile, Manage Security Profiles. Add a New Exploit Security Profile
Exploit security profiles allow to configure the action the Cortex XDR agent takes when attempts to exploit software vulnerabilities or flaws occur. To protect against specific exploit techniques, customize exploit protection capabilities in each Exploit security profile.
By default, the Cortex XDR agent will receive the default profile that contains a pre-defined configuration for each exploit capability supported by the platform. To fine-tune Exploit security policy, override the configuration of each capability to block the exploit behavior, allow the behavior but report it, or disable the module.
To define an Exploit security profile:
- STEP 1 | Add a new profile.
1. From Cortex XDR, select Endpoints > Policy Management > Profiles > + New Profile.
2. Select the platform to which the profile applies and Exploit as the profile type.
3. ClickNext.
- STEP 2 | Define the basic settings.
1. Enter a unique Profile Name to identify the profile. The name can contain only letters, numbers, or spaces, and must be no more than 30 characters. The name choose will be visible from the list of profiles when configure a policy rule.
2. To provide additional context for the purpose or business reason that explains why are creating the profile, enter a profile Description. For example, might include an incident identification number or a link to a help desk ticket.
- STEP 3 | Configure the action to take when the Cortex XDR agent detects an attempt to exploit each type of software flaw.
For details on the different exploit protection capabilities, see Endpoint Protection Capabilities.
- Block—Block the exploit attack.
- Report—Allow the exploit activity but report it to Cortex XDR.
- Disabled—Disable the module and do not analyze or report exploit attempts.
- Default—Use the default configuration to determine the action to take. Cortex XDR displays the
current default configuration for each capability in parenthesis. For example, Default (Block).
To view which processes are protected by each capability, see Processes Protected by Exploit Security
Policy.
For Logical Exploits Protection, also configure a block list for the DLL Hijacking module. The block list enables to block specific DLLs when run by a protected process. The DLL folder or file must include the complete path. To complete the path, use environment variables or the asterisk (*) as a wildcard to match any string of characters (for example, */windows32/).
For Exploit Protection for Additional Processes, also add one or more additional processes.

  In Exploit Security profiles, if change the action mode for processes, must restart the protected processes for the following security modules to take effect on the process and its forked processes: Brute Force Protection, Java Deserialization, ROP, and SO Hijacking.
- STEP 4 | Save the changes to profile. STEP 5 | Apply Security Profiles to Endpoints. do this in two ways: Create a new policy rule using this profile from the right-click menu or launch the new policy wizard from Policy Rules.
Processes Protected by Exploit Security Policy
By default, exploit security profile protects endpoints from attack techniques that target specific processes. Each exploit protection capability protects a different set of processes that Palo Alto Networks researchers determine are susceptible to attack. The following tables display the processes that are protected by each exploit protection capability for each operating system.

 Add a New Malware Security Profile
Malware security profiles allow to configure the action Cortex XDR agents take when known malware and unknown files try to run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android endpoints.
By default, the Cortex XDR agent will receive the default profile that contains a pre-defined configuration for each malware protection capability supported by the platform. To fine-tune Malware security policy, override the configuration of each capability to block the malicious behavior or file, allow but report it, or disable the module. For each setting override, clear the option to Use Default.
To configure a Malware security profile:
- STEP 1 | Add a new profile.
1. From Cortex XDR, select Endpoints > Policy Management > Profiles > + New Profile. 2. Select the platform to which the profile applies and Malware as the profile type.
- STEP 2 | Identify the profile.
1. Enter a unique Profile Name to identify the profile. The name can contain only letters, numbers, or spaces, and must be no more than 30 characters. The name choose will be visible from the list of profiles when configure a policy rule.
2. To provide additional context for the purpose or business reason that explains why are creating the profile, enter a profile Description. For example, might include an incident identification number or a link to a help desk ticket.
- STEP 3 | Configure the Cortex XDR agent to examine executable files, macros, PDFs, or DLL files on Windows endpoints, Mach-O files or DMG files on Mac endpoints, ELF files on Linux endpoints, or APK files on Android endpoints.
1. Configure the Action Mode—the behavior of the Cortex XDR agent—when malware is detected:
- Block—Block attempts to run malware.
- Report—Report but do not block malware that attempts to run.
- (Android only) Prompt—Enable the Cortex XDR agent to prompt the user when malware is
detected and allow the user to choose to allow malware, dismiss the notification, or uninstall the
app.
- Disabled—Disable the module and do not examine files for malware.
2. Configure additional actions to examine files for malware.
By default, Cortex XDR uses the settings specified in the default malware security profile and displays the default configuration in parenthesis. When select a setting other than the default, override the default configuration for the profile.
- (Windows only) Quarantine Malicious Executables—By default, the Cortex XDR agent blocks malware from running but does not quarantine the file. Enable this option to quarantine files depending on the verdict issuer (local analysis, WildFire, or both local analysis and WildFire.
The quarantine feature is not available for malware identified in network drives.
- Upload <file_type> files for cloud analysis—Enable the Cortex XDR agent to send unknown files
to Cortex XDR, and for Cortex XDR to send the files to WildFire for analysis. With macro analysis, the Cortex XDR agent sends the Microsoft Office file containing the macro. The file types that the Cortex XDR agent analyzes depend on the platform type. WildFire accepts files up to 100MB in size.
- Treat Grayware as Malware—Treat all grayware with the same Action Mode configure for malware. Otherwise, if this option is disabled, grayware is considered benign and is not blocked.
- Action on Unknown to WildFire—Select the behavior of the Cortex XDR agent when an unknown file tries to run on the endpoint (Allow, Run Local Analysis, or Block). With local analysis, the

 Cortex XDR agent uses embedded machine learning to determine the likelihood that an unknown file is malware and issues a local verdict for the file. If block unknown files but do not run local analysis, unknown files remain blocked until the Cortex XDR agent receives an official WildFire verdict.
- (Windows only) Examine Office Files From Network Drives—Enable the Cortex XDR agent to examine Microsoft Office files in network drives when they contain a macro that attempts to run. If this option is disabled, the Cortex XDR agent will not examine macros in network drives.
(Windows only) As part of the anti-malware security flow, the Cortex XDR agent leverages the OS capability to identify revoked certificates for executables and
DLL files that attempt to run on the endpoint by accessing the Windows Certificate Revocation List (CRL). To allow the Cortex XDR agent access the CRL, must enable internet access over port 80 for Windows endpoints running Traps 6.0.3 and later releases, Traps 6.1.1 and later releases, or Cortex XDR 7.0 and later releases. If the endpoint is not connected to the internet, or experience delays with executables and DLLs running on the endpoint, please contact Palo Alto Networks Support.
3. (Optional) Add files and folders to allow list to exclude them from examination.
1. +Add a file or folder.
2. Enter the path and press Enter or click the check mark when done. also use a wildcard to
match files and folders containing a partial name. Use ? to match a single character or * to match any string of characters. To match a folder, must terminate the path with * to match all files in the folder (for example, c:\temp\*).
3. Repeat to add additional files or folders.
4. Add signers to allow list to exclude them from examination.
When a file that is signed by a signer included in allow list attempts to run,
1. +Add a trusted signer.
2. Enter the name of the trusted signer (Windows) or the SHA1 hash of the certificate that signs
the file (Mac) and press Enter or click the check mark when done. also use a wildcard to match a partial name for the signer. Use ? to match any single character or * to match any string of characters.
3. Repeat to add additional folders.
- STEP 4 | (Windows, Mac, and Linux only) Configure Behavioral Threat Protection.
Behavioral threat protection requires Traps agent 6.0 or a later release for Windows endpoints, and Traps 6.1 or later versions for Mac and Linux endpoints.
With Behavioral threat protection, the agent continuously monitors endpoint activity to identify and analyze chains of events—known as causality chains. This enables the agent to detect malicious activity in the chain that could otherwise appear legitimate if inspected individually. A causality chain can include any sequence of network, process, file, and registry activities on the endpoint. For more information on data collection for Behavioral Threat Protection, see Endpoint Data Collected by Cortex XDR.
Palo Alto Networks researchers define the causality chains that are malicious and distribute those chains as behavioral threat rules. When the Cortex XDR agent detects a match to a behavioral threat protection rule, the Cortex XDR agent carries out the configured action (default is Block). In addition, the Cortex XDR agent reports the behavior of the entire event chain up to the process, known as the causality group owner (CGO), that the Cortex XDR agent identified as triggering the event sequence.
To configure Behavioral Threat Protection
1. Define the Action mode to take when the Cortex XDR agent detects malicious causality chains:

 - Block (default)—Block all processes and threads in the event chain up to the CGO.
- Report—Allow the activity but report it to Cortex XDR.
- Disabled—Disable the module and do not analyze or report the activity.
2. Define whether to quarantine the CGO when the Cortex XDR agent detects a malicious event chain.
- Enabled—Quarantine the CGO if the file is not signed by a highly trusted signer. When the CGO is signed by a highly trusted signer or powershell.exe, wscript.exe, cscript.exe, mshta.exe, excel.exe, word.exe or powerpoint.exe, the Cortex XDR agent parses the command-line arguments and instead quarantines any scripts or files called by the CGO.
- Disabled (default)—Do not quarantine the CGO of an event chain nor any scripts or files called by the CGO.
3. (Optional) Add to allow list files that do not want the Cortex XDR agent to terminate when a malicious causality chain is detected.
1. +Add a file path.
2. Enter the file path want to exclude from evaluation. Use ? to match a single character or * to
match any string of characters.
3. Click the check mark to confirm the file path.
4. Repeat the process to add any additional file paths to allow list.
- STEP 5 | (Windows only) Configure Ransomware Protection
1. Define the Action mode to take when the Cortex XDR agent detects ransomware activity locally on
the endpoint or in pre-defined network folders:
- Block (default)—Block the activity.
- Report—Allow the activity but report it to Cortex XDR.
- Disabled—Disable the module and do not analyze or report the activity.
2. Configure the ransomware module Protection mode.
By default, the protection mode is set to Normal where the decoy files on the endpoint are present, but do not interfere with benign applications and end user activity on the endpoint. If suspect network has been infected with ransomware and need to provide better coverage, apply the Aggressive protection mode. The aggressive mode exposes more applications in environment to the Cortex XDR agent decoy files, while also increasing the likelihood that benign software is exposed to decoy files, raising false ransomware alerts, and impairing user experience.
- STEP 6 | (Windows only) Configure the Cortex XDR agent to Prevent Malicious Child Process Execution.
1. Select the Action Mode to take when the Cortex XDR agent detects malicious child process
execution:
- Block—Block the activity.
- Report—Allow the activity but report it to Cortex XDR.
2. To allow specific processes to launch child processes for legitimate purposes, add the child process to
allow list with optional execution criteria.
+Add and then specify the allow list criteria including the Parent Process Name, Child Process Name,
and Command Line Params. Use ? to match a single character or * to match any string of characters.


   If are adding child process evaluation criteria based on a specific security event, the event indicates both the source process and the command line parameters in one line. Copy only the command line parameter for use in the profile.
- STEP 7 | (Windows and Mac only) Enable endpoint file scanning.
Periodic scanning enables to scan endpoints on a reoccurring basis without waiting for malware to
run on the endpoint.
1. Configure the Action Mode for the Cortex XDR agent to periodically scan the endpoint for malware: Enabled to scan at the configured intervals, Disabled (default) if don’t want the Cortex XDR agent to scan the endpoint.
2. To configure the scan schedule, set the frequency (Run Weekly or Run Monthly) and day and time at which the scan will run on the endpoint.
Just as with an on-demand scan, a scheduled scan will resume after a reboot, process interruption, or
operating system crash.
3. (Windows only) To include removable media drives in the scheduled scan, enable the Cortex XDR
agent to Scan Removable Media Drives.

 4. Add folders allow list to exclude them from examination.
1. Add (+) a folder.
2. Enter the folder path. Use ? to match a single character or * to match any string of characters in
the folder path (for example, C:\*\temp).
3. Press Enter or click the check mark when done.
4. Repeat to add additional folders.
- STEP 8 | (Windows Vista and later Windows releases) Enable Password Theft Protection.
Select Enabled to enable the Cortex XDR agent to prevent attacks that use the Mimikatz tool to extract passwords from memory. When set to Enabled, the Cortex XDR agent silently prevents attempts to steal credentials (no notifications are provided when these events occur). The Cortex XDR agent enables this protection module following the next endpoint reboot. If don’t want to enable the module, select Disabled.
This module is supported with Traps agent 5.0.4 and later release.
- STEP 9 | (Linux only) Enable Local File Threat Examination.
The Local Threat-Evaluation Engine (LTEE) enables the Cortex XDR agent to detect webshells and
optionally quarantine malicious PHP files on the endpoint.
This module is supported with Cortex XDR agent 7.2.0 and later release.
1. Select the Action Mode to take when the Cortex XDR agent detects the malicious behavior.
- Enable—Enable the Cortex XDR agent to analyze the endpoint for PHP files arriving from the web server and alert of any malicious PHP scripts.
- Disable—Disable the module and do not analyze or report the activity.
2. Quarantine malicious files.
When Enabled, the Cortex XDR agents quarantine malicious PHP files on the endpoint. The agent
quarantines newly created PHP files only, and does not quarantine updated files.
3. (Optional) Add files and folders to allow list to exclude them from examination.
1. +Add a file or folder.
2. Enter the path and press Enter or click the check mark when done. also use * to match
files and folders containing a partial name. To match a folder, must terminate the path with *
to match all files in the folder (for example, /usr/bin/*).
3. Repeat to add additional files or folders.
- STEP 10 | (Linux only) Configure Reverse Shell Protection.
The Reverse Shell Protection module enables the Cortex XDR agent to detect and optionally block
attempts to redirect standard input and output streams to network sockets.
1. Define the Action Mode to take when the Cortex XDR agent detects the malicious behavior.
- Block—Block the activity.
- Report—Allow the activity but report it to Cortex XDR.
- Disabled—Disable the module and do not analyze or report the activity.
2. (Optional) Add processes to allow list that must redirect streams to network sockets.
1. +Add a connection.
2. Enter the path of the process, and the local and remote IP address and ports.

 Use a wildcard to match a partial path name. Use a * to match any string of characters (for example, */bash). also use a * to match any IP address or any port.
3. Press Enter or click the check mark when done.
4. Repeat to add additional folders.
- STEP 11 | Save the changes to profile. STEP 12 | Apply Security Profiles to Endpoints. do this in two ways: Create a new policy rule using this profile from the right-click menu or launch the new policy wizard from Policy Rules.
WildFire Analysis Concepts
- File Forwarding
- File Type Analysis
- Verdicts
- Local Verdict Cache
File Forwarding
Cortex XDR sends unknown samples for in-depth analysis to WildFire. WildFire accepts up to 1,000,000 sample uploads per day and up to 1,000,000 verdict queries per day from each Cortex XDR tenant. The daily limit resets at 23:59:00 UTC. Uploads that exceed the sample limit are queued for analysis after the limit resets. WildFire also limits sample sizes to 100MB. For more information, see the WildFire documentation.
For samples that the Cortex XDR agent reports, the agent first checks its local cache of hashes to determine if it has an existing verdict for that sample. If the Cortex XDR agent does not have a local verdict, the Cortex XDR agent queries Cortex XDR to determine if WildFire has previously analyzed the sample. If the sample is identified as malware, it is blocked. If the sample remains unknown after comparing it against existing WildFire signatures, Cortex XDR forwards the sample for WildFire analysis.
File Type Analysis
The Cortex XDR agent analyzes files based on the type of file, regardless of the file’s extension. For deep inspection and analysis, also configure Cortex XDR to forward samples to WildFire. A sample can be:
 - Any Portable Executable (PE) file including (but not limited to):
- Executable files
- Object code
- FON (Fonts)
- Microsoft Windows screensaver (.scr) files

 - Microsoft Office files containing macros opened in Microsoft Word (winword.exe) and Microsoft Excel (excel.exe):
- Microsoft Office 2003 to Office 2016—.doc and .xls
- Microsoft Office 2010 and later releases—.docm, .docx, .xlsm, and .xlsx
- Portable Document Format (PDF) files
- Dynamic-link library file including (but not limited to):
- .dll files
- .ocx files
- Android application package (APK) files
- Mach-o files
- DMG files
- Linux (ELF) files
For information on file-examination settings, see Add a New Malware Security Profile.
Verdicts
WildFire delivers verdicts to identify samples it analyzes as safe, malicious, or unwanted (grayware is considered obtrusive but not malicious):
- Unknown—Initial verdict for a sample for which WildFire has received but has not analyzed.
- Benign—The sample is safe and does not exhibit malicious behavior.
- Malware—The sample is malware and poses a security threat. Malware can include viruses, worms,
Trojans, Remote Access Tools (RATs), rootkits, botnets, and malicious macros. For files identified as
malware, WildFire generates and distributes a signature to prevent against future exposure to the threat.
- Grayware—The sample does not pose a direct security threat, but might display otherwise obtrusive
behavior. Grayware typically includes adware, spyware, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs).
When WildFire is not available or integration is disabled, the Cortex XDR agent can also assign a local verdict for the sample using additional methods of evaluation: When the Cortex XDR agent performs local analysis on a file, it uses machine learning to determine the verdict. The Cortex XDR agent can also compare the signer of a file with a local list of trusted signers to determine whether a file is malicious:
- Local analysis verdicts:
- Benign—Local analysis determined the sample is safe and does not exhibit malicious behavior.
- Malware—The sample is malware and poses a security threat. Malware can include viruses, worms,
Trojans, Remote Access Tools (RATs), rootkits, botnets, and malicious macros.
- Trusted signer verdicts:
- Trusted—The sample is signed by a trusted signer.
- Not Trusted—The sample is not signed by a trusted signer.
Local Verdict Cache
The Cortex XDR agent stores hashes and the corresponding verdicts for all files that attempt to run on the endpoint inits local cache. The local cache scales in size to accommodate the number of unique executable files opened on the endpoint. On Windows endpoints, the cache is stored in the C:\ProgramData \Cyvera\LocalSystem folder on the endpoint. When service protection is enabled (see Add a New Agent Settings Profile), the local cache is accessible only by the Cortex XDR agent and cannot be changed.
Each time a file attempts to run, the Cortex XDR agent performs a lookup in its local cache to determine if a verdict already exists. If known, the verdict is either the official WildFire verdict or manually set as a hash exception. Hash exceptions take precedence over any additional verdict analysis.
If the file is unknown in the local cache, the Cortex XDR agent queries Cortex XDR for the verdict. If Cortex XDR receives a verdict request for a file that was already analyzed, Cortex XDR immediately responds to the Cortex XDR agent with the verdict.
 116

 If Cortex XDR does not have a verdict for the file, it queries WildFire and optionally submits the file for analysis. While the Cortex XDR agent attempts waits for an official WildFire verdict, it can use File Analysis and Protection Flow to evaluate the file. After Cortex XDR receives the verdict it responds to the Cortex XDR agent that requested the verdict.
For information on file-examination settings, see Add a New Malware Security Profile. Add a New Restrictions Security Profile
Restrictions security profiles limit the surface of an attack on a Windows endpoint by defining where and how users can run files.
By default, the Cortex XDR agent will receive the default profile that contains a pre-defined configuration for each restrictions capability. To customize the configuration for specific Cortex XDR agents, configure a new Restrictions security profile and assign it to one or more policy rules.
To define a Restrictions security profile:
- STEP 1 | Add a new profile.
1. From Cortex XDR, select Endpoints > Policy Management > Profiles > + New Profile.
2. Select the platform to which the profile applies and Restrictions as the profile type.
3. ClickNext.
- STEP 2 | Define the basic settings.
1. Enter a unique Profile Name to identify the profile. The name can contain only letters, numbers, or spaces, and must be no more than 30 characters. The name choose will be visible from the list of profiles when configure a policy rule.
2. To provide additional context for the purpose or business reason that explains why are creating the profile, enter a profile Description. For example, might include an incident identification number or a link to a help desk ticket.
- STEP 3 | Configure each of the Restrictions Endpoint Protection Capabilities.
1. Configure the action to take when a file attempts to run from a specified location.
- Block—Block the file execution.
- Notify—Allow the file to execute but notify the user that the file is attempting to run from a
suspicious location. The Cortex XDR agent also reports the event to Cortex XDR.
- Report—Allow the file to execute but report it to Cortex XDR.
- Disabled—Disable the module and do not analyze or report execution attempts from restricted
locations.
2. Add files to allow list or block list, as needed.
The type of protection capability determines whether the capability supports an allow list, block list, or both. With an allow list, the action mode configure applies to all the paths except for those that specify. With a block list, the action applies only to the paths that specify.
1. +Adda file or folder.
2. Enter the path and press Enter or click the check mark when done. also use a wildcard
to match a partial name for the folder and environment variables. Use ? to match any single character or * to match any string of characters. To match a folder, must terminate the path with * to match all files in the folder (for example, c:\temp\*).
3. Repeat to add additional folders.
- STEP 4 | Save the changes to profile.

- STEP 5 | Apply Security Profiles to Endpoints. do this in two ways: Create a new policy rule using this profile from the right-click
menu or launch the new policy wizard from Policy Rules. Manage Security Profiles

1. From Cortex XDR, select Endpoints > Policy Management > Profiles > + New Profile.
2. Select the platform to which the profile applies and Agent Settings as the profile type.
3. ClickNext.
- STEP 2 | Define the basic settings.
1. Enter a unique Profile Name to identify the profile. The name can contain only letters, numbers, or spaces, and must be no more than 30 characters. The name choose will be visible from the list of profiles when configure a policy rule.
2. To provide additional context for the purpose or business reason that explains why are creating the profile, enter a profile Description. For example, might include an incident identification number or a link to a help desk ticket.
- STEP 3 | (Windows, Mac, and Linux only) Configure the Disk Space to allot for Cortex XDR agent logs. Specify a value in MB from 100 to 10,000 (default is 5,000).
- STEP 4 | (Windows and Mac only) Configure User Interface options for the Cortex XDR console.
By default, Cortex XDR uses the settings specified in the default agent settings profile and displays the default configuration in parenthesis. When select a setting other than the default, override the default configuration for the profile.
- Tray Icon—Choose whether want the Cortex XDR agent icon to be Visible (default) or Hidden in the notification area (system tray).
- XDR Agent Console Access—Enable this option to allow access to the Cortex XDR console.
- XDR Agent User Notifications—Enable this option to operate display notifications in the notifications
area on the endpoint. When disabled, the Cortex XDR agent operates in silent mode where the Cortex XDR agent does not display any notifications in the notification area. If enable notifications, use the default notification messages, or provide custom text (up to 50 characters) for each notification type. also customize a notification footer.
- Live Terminal User Notifications—Enable this option to display a pop-up on the endpoint when initiate a Live Terminal session.
- STEP 5 | (Android only) Configure network usage preferences.
   Advanced Analysis
Enable Cortex XDR to automatically upload alert data for secondary verdict verification and security policy tuning.
                        —

 When the option to Upload Using Cellular Data is enabled, the Cortex XDR agent uses cellular data to send unknown apps to the Cortex XDR for inspection. Standard data charges may apply. When this option is disabled, the Cortex XDR agent queues any unknown files and sends them when the endpoint connects to a Wi-Fi network. If configured, the data usage setting on the Android endpoint takes precedence over this configuration.
- STEP 6 | (Windows only) Configure Agent Security options that prevent unauthorized access or tampering with the Cortex XDR agent components.
Use the default agent settings or customize them for the profile. To customize agent security capabilities:
1. Enable XDR Agent Tampering Protection.
2. By default, the Cortex XDR agent protects all agent components, however configure
protection more granularly for Cortex XDR agent services, processes, files, and registry values. With Traps 5.0.6 and later releases, when protection is enabled, access will be read-only. In earlier Traps releases, enabling protection disables all access to services, processes, files, and registry values.
- STEP 7 | (Windows and Mac only) Set an Uninstall Password.
Define and confirm a password the user must enter to uninstall the Cortex XDR agent. The uninstall password is encrypted using encryption algorithm (PBKDF2) when transferred between Cortex XDR and Cortex XDR agents. Additionally, the uninstall password is used to protect tampering attempts when using Cytool commands.
The default uninstall password is Password1. A new password must satisfy the following requirements:
- Contain eight or more characters.
- Contain English letters, numbers, or any of the following symbols: !()-._`~@#"'. STEP 8 | (Windows only) Configure Windows Security Center Integration.
The Windows Security Center is a reporting tool that monitors the system health and security state of Windows endpoints on Windows 7 and later releases. When Enabled, the Cortex XDR agent registers with the Windows Security Center as an official Antivirus (AV) software product. When registration is Disabled, the Cortex XDR agent does not register to the Windows Action Center. As a result, Windows Action Center could indicate that Virus protection is Off, depending on other security products that are installed on the endpoint.
For the Cortex XDR agent 5.0 release only, if want to register the agent to the Windows Security Center but prevent from Windows to automatically install Meltdown/Spectra vulnerability patches on the endpoint, change the setting to Enabled (No Patches).
When Enable the Cortex XDR agent to register to the Windows Security Center, Windows shuts down Microsoft Defender on the endpoint automatically. If still want to allow Microsoft Defender to run on the endpoint where Cortex XDR is installed, must Disable this option. However, Palo Alto Networks does not recommend running Windows Defender and the Cortex XDR agent on the same endpoint since it might cause performance issues and incompatibility issues with Global Protect and other applications.
- STEP 9 | (Windows only) Configure Forensics alert data collection options.
When the Cortex XDR agent alerts on process-related activity on the endpoint, the Cortex XDR agent collects the contents of memory and other data about the event in what is known as a alert data dump file. customize the Alert Data Dump File Size—Small, Medium, or Full (the largest and most complete set of information)—and whether to Automatically Upload Alert Data Dump File to Cortex XDR. During event investigation, if automatic uploading of the alert data dump file was disabled, manually retrieve the data.

- STEP 10 | (Windows, Mac, and Linux only) Enable the Cortex XDR agent to Monitor and Collect Enhanced Endpoint Data for use by apps on the Cortex platform.
Event monitoring and data collection requires:
- A Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint license.
- A supported agent version—Traps agent 6.0 or a later release for Windows endpoints
and Traps agent 6.1 or later releases for Mac and Linux endpoints.
- Log storage allocated to EDR endpoint data in Cortex Data Lake instance.
By default, the Cortex XDR agent collects information about events that occur on the endpoint. If enable Behavioral Threat Protection in a Malware Security profile, the Cortex XDR agent also collects information about all active file, process, network, and registry activity on an endpoint (see Endpoint Data Collected by Cortex XDR).
When enable the Cortex XDR agent to monitor and collect enhanced endpoint data, enable Cortex XDR to share the detailed endpoint information with other Cortex apps. The information can help to provide the endpoint context when a security event occurs so that gain insight on the overall event scope during investigation. The event scope includes all activities that took place during an attack, the endpoints that were involved, and the damage caused. When disabled, the Cortex XDR agent will not share endpoint activity logs.
- STEP 11 | (Windows only, Requires Cortex XDR agents 7.2 and later releases) Enable File Search and Destroy.
When enable File search and destroy, the Cortex XDR agent collects detailed information about files on the endpoint to create a files inventory database. The agent locally monitors any actions performed on these files and updates the local files database in real-time. choose to include in the files database all file types or common file types only. Additionally, exclude from the files database all the files that exist under a specific local path on the endpoint.
The common file types are: doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, pdf, pages, keynote, rtf, txt, vsd, vsdx, dwg, dxf, csv, url, dotm, docm, xlm, xlsm, xlb, xltm, xltx, xlt, xla, dotx, docb, pot, pptm, potm, ppam, ppsm, sldx, sldm, xps, pub, zip, rar, 7z, gz, tar, cab, ps1, vb, vbe, vbs, js, cmd, bat, vbscript, wsf, jar, db, dbf, mdf, sdf, sql, sqlite, sqlite3, myd, mdb, jpg, jpeg, bmp, gif, exif, png, svg, c, cpp, py, and java.
- STEP 12 | (Windows only) Response Actions.
If need to isolate an endpoint but want to allow access for a specific application (for example communication between the VDI process and a VDI server), add the process to the Network Isolation Allow List.
If Cortex XDR agents communicate with Cortex XDR through a proxy, must add to allow list the following Cortex XDR agent processes along with the IP address of the proxy server:
- C:\Program Files\Palo Alto Networks\Traps\tlaservice.exe
- C:\Program Files\Palo Alto Networks\Traps\cyserver.exe
- For Cortex XDR agent release prior to 7.1.0 only - C:\Program Files\Palo Alto
Networks\Traps\cyveraservice.exe
This enables the Cortex XDR agent to maintain communication with Cortex XDR after isolate the endpoint.

  When add a specific application to allow list from network isolation, the Cortex XDR agent continues to block some internal system processes. This is because some applications, for example ping.exe, can use other processes to facilitate network communication. As a result, if the Cortex XDR agent continues to block an application included in allow list, may need to perform additional network monitoring to determine the process that facilitates the communication, and then add that process to the allow list.
1. +Add an entry to the allow list.
2. Specify the Process Path want to allow and the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the endpoint. Use the
* wildcard on either side to match any process or IP address. For example, specify * as the process path and an IP address to allow any process to run on the isolated endpoint with that IP address. Conversely, specify * as the IP address and a specific process path to allow the process to run on any isolated endpoint that receives this profile.
3. Click the check mark when finished.
- STEP 13 | (Windows only) Specify the Content Configuration for Cortex XDR agents.
have several option to configure how Cortex XDR agent retrieves new content.
- Download Source—Cortex XDR deploys serverless peer-to-peer P2P content distribution to Cortex XDR agents in LAN network by default to reduce bandwidth loads. Within the six hour randomization window during which the Cortex XDR agent attempts to retrieve the new content version, it will broadcast its peer agents on the same subnet twice: once within the first hour, and once again during the following five hours. If the agent did not retrieve the new content from other agents in both queries, it will retrieve it from Cortex XDR directly. If do not want to allow P2P content distribution, select the Cortex Server download source to allow all Cortex XDR agents
in network to retrieve the content directly from the Cortex XDR server on their following heartbeat.
To enable P2P, must enable UDP and TCP over the defined PORT in Content Download Source. By default, Cortex XDR uses port 33221. configure another port number.
Limitations in the content download process:
- When install the Cortex XDR agent, the agent retrieves the latest content update version available. A freshly installed agent can take between five to ten minutes (depending on network and content update settings) to retrieve the content for the first time. During this time, endpoint is not protected.
- When upgrade a Cortex XDR agent to a newer Cortex XDR agent version, if the new agent cannot use the content version running on the endpoint, then the new content update will start within one minute in P2P and within five minutes from Cortex XDR.
- Content Auto-update—By default, the Cortex XDR agent always retrieves the most updated content and deploys it on the endpoint so it is always protected with the latest security measures. However, Disable the automatic content download. Then, the agent stops retrieving content updates from the Cortex XDR Server and keeps working with the current content on the endpoint.
- If disable content updates for a newly installed agent, the agent will retrieve the content for the first time from Cortex XDR and then disable content updates on the endpoint.
- When add a Cortex XDR agent to an endpoints group with disabled content auto-upgrades policy, then the policy is applied to the added agent as well.
- Content Rollout—The Cortex XDR agent can retrieve content updates Immediately as they are available, or after a pre-configured Delayed period. When delay content updates, the Cortex

 XDR agent will retrieve the content according to the configured delay. For example, if configure a delay period of two days, the agent will not use any content released in the last 48 hours.
If disable or delay automatic-content updates provided by Palo Alto Networks, it may affect the security level in organization.
- STEP 14 | Enable Agent Auto Upgrade for Cortex XDR agents.
To ensure endpoints are always up-to-date with the latest Cortex XDR agent release, enable automatic agent upgrades. For increased flexibility, choose to apply automatic upgrades to major releases only, to minor releases only, or to both. It can take up to 15 minutes for new and updated auto-upgrade profile settings to take effect on endpoints.
Automatic agent upgrades are not supported with non-persistent VDI and temporary sessions.
To control the agent auto upgrade scheduler and number of parallel upgrades in network, see Configure Global Agent Settings.
Automatic upgrades are not supported with non-persistent VDI and temporary sessions.
- STEP 15 | Enable Network Location Configuration for Cortex XDR agents.
(Requires Cortex XDR agents 7.1 and later releases) If configure host firewall rules in network,
must enable Cortex XDR to determine the network location of device, as follows:
1. A domain controller (DC) connectivity test— When Enabled, the DC test checks whether the device is connected to the internal network or not. If the device is connected to the internal network, then it is in the organization. Otherwise, if the DC test failed or returned an external domain, Cortex XDR proceeds to a DNS connectivity test.
2. A DNS test—In the DNS test, the Cortex XDR agent submits a DNS name that is known only to the internal network. If the DNS returned the pre-configured internal IP, then the device is within the organization. Otherwise, if the DNS IP cannot be resolved, then the device is located elsewhere. Enter the IP Address and DNS Server Name for the test.
If the Cortex XDR agent detects a network change on the endpoint, the agent triggers the device location test, and re-calculates the policy according to the new location.
- STEP 16 | Save the changes to profile. STEP 17 | Apply Security Profiles to Endpoints. do this in two ways: Create a new policy rule using this profile from the right-click menu or launch the new policy wizard from Policy Rules.
Configure Global Agent Settings
On top of customizable Agent Settings Profiles for each Operating System and different endpoint targets, set global Agent Configurations that apply to all the endpoints in network.
- STEP 1 | From Cortex XDR, select > Settings > Agent Configuration. STEP 2 | Set global uninstall password.

 The uninstall password is required to remove a Cortex XDR agent and to grant access to agent security component on the endpoint. use the default uninstall Password1 defined in Cortex XDR or set a new one and Save. This global uninstall password applies to all the endpoints (excluding mobile) in network. If change the password later on, the new default password applies to all new and existing profiles to which it applied before. If want to use a different password to uninstall specific agents, override the default global uninstall password by setting a different password for those agents in the Agent Settings profile.
- STEP 3 | Configure content bandwidth allocated for all endpoints.
To control the amount of bandwidth allocated in network to Cortex XDR content updates, assign a Content bandwidth management value between 20-10,000 Mbps. To help with this calculation, Cortex XDR recommends the optimal value of Mbps based on the number of active agents in network, and including overhead considerations for large content updates. Cortex XDR will verify that agents attempting to download the content update are within the allocated bandwidth before beginning the distribution. If the bandwidth has reached its cap, the download will be refused and the agents will attempt again at a later time. After set the bandwidth, Save the configuration.
- STEP 4 | Configure the Cortex XDR agent auto upgrade scheduler and number of parallel upgrades.
If Agent Auto Upgrades are enabled for Cortex XDR agents, control the automatic upgrade
process in network:
- Number of agents per batch—Set the number of parallel agent upgrades, while the minimum is 500 agents.
- Task scheduler schedule the upgrade task for specific days of the week and a specific time range. The minimum range is four hours.
- STEP 5 | Enable Cortex XDR to collect endpoint data for Host Insights and Host Inventory and Vulnerability Management.
- Enable vulnerability assessment data to allow the Cortex XDR agent to collect information about applications installed on the endpoint, including CVE and installed KBs.
- Enable endpoint information to allow the Cortex XDR agent to collect information about users, groups, services, drivers, hardware, and network shares.
- STEP 6 | Configure automated Advanced Analysis of XDR Agent alerts raised by exploit protection modules.
Advanced Analysis is an additional verification method use to validate the verdict issued by the Cortex XDR agent. In addition, Advanced Analysis also helps Palo Alto Networks researchers tune exploit protection modules for accuracy.
To initiate additional analysis must retrieve data about the alert from the endpoint. do this manually on an alert-by-alert basis or enable Cortex XDR to automatically retrieve the files.
After Cortex XDR receives the data, it automatically analyzes the memory contents and renders a verdict. When the analysis is complete, Cortex XDR displays the results in the Advanced Analysis field of the Additional data view for the data retrieval action on the Action Center. If the Advanced Analysis verdict is benign, avoid subsequent blocked files for users that encounter the same behavior by enabling Cortex XDR to automatically create and distribute exceptions based on the Advanced Analysis results.
1. Configure the desired options:
- Enable Cortex XDR to automatically upload defined alert data files for advanced analysis.
Advanced Analysis increases the Cortex XDR exploit protection module accuracy

 - Automatically apply Advanced Analysis exceptions to Global Exceptions list. This will apply all Advanced Analysis exceptions suggested by Cortex XDR, regardless of the alert data file source
2. Save the Advanced Analysis configuration. Endpoint Data Collected by Cortex XDR
When the Cortex XDR agent alerts on endpoint activity, the agent collects a minimum set of data about the endpoint as described in Data Collected for All Alerts.
When enable behavioral threat protection or EDR data collection in endpoint security policy, the Cortex XDR agent can also continuously monitor endpoint activity for malicious event chains identified by Palo Alto Networks. The endpoint data that the Cortex XDR agent collects when enable these capabilities varies by the platform type:
- Additional Endpoint Data Collected for Windows Endpoints
- Windows Event Logs
- Additional Endpoint Data Collected for Mac Endpoints
- Additional Endpoint Data Collected for Linux Endpoints
Data Collected for All Alerts
When Cortex XDR raises an alert on an endpoint, the Cortex XDR agent collects the following data and sends it to Cortex XDR.

### Apply Security Profiles to Endpoints
Cortex XDR provides out-of-the-box protection for all registered endpoints with a default security policy customized for each supported platform type. To tune security policy, customize settings in a security profile and attach the profile to a policy. Each policy that create must apply to one or more endpoints or endpoint groups.

### Exceptions Security Profiles
To allow full granularity, Cortex XDR allows to create exceptions from baseline policy. These exceptions allow to remove specific folders or paths from exemption or disable specific security modules. In Cortex XDR, configure the following types of policy exceptions:
  Exception Type
    Description
  Process exceptions
Support exceptions
Behavioral Threat Protection Rule Exception Digital Signer Exception
Java Deserialization Exception
Local File Threat Examination Exception
There are two types of exceptions create:
Define an exception for a specific process for one or more security modules.
Import an exception from the Cortex XDR Support team.
An exception disabling a specific BTP rule across all processes.
(Windows only) An exception adding a digital signer to the list of allowed signers.
(Linux only) An exception allowing specific Java executable (jar, class).
(Linux only) An exception allowing specific PHP files.
                      - Policy exceptions that apply to specific policies and endpoints (see Add a New Exceptions Security Profile)
- Global exceptions that apply to all policies (see Add a Global Endpoint Policy Exception)
To help manage and asses BIOC/IOC rules, Cortex XDR automatically creates a System Generated rule exception if the same BIOC/IOC rule is detected by the same initiator hash within a 3 day timeframe on 100 different endpoints.
Each time a BIOC/IOC alert is detected, the 3 day timeframe begins counting down. If after 3 days without an alert, the 3 day timeframe is reset. For example:
  Day Number
    BIOC/IOC Detections
    Action
  Example A
1 98 Detections
2 1 Detection
4 1 Detection
No exception created No exception created
System Generated exception created
                        Example B


   Day Number
    BIOC/IOC Detections
    Action
  1 98 Detections No exception created
2 1 Detection No exception created

 that exist for applications installed on endpoints.
Device Control
By default, all external USB devices are allowed to connect to Cortex XDR endpoints. To protect endpoints from connecting USB-connected removable devices—such as disk drives, CD-ROM drives, floppy disk drives, and other portable devices—that can contain malicious files, Cortex XDR provides device control.
For example, with device control,:
- Block all supported USB-connected devices for an endpoint group.
- Block a USB device type but add to allow list a specific vendor from that list that will be accessible
from the endpoint.
- Temporarily block only some USB device types on an endpoint.
Before start applying device control policy rules, ensure meet the following requirements and refer to these known limitations:
- Windows—Ensure the endpoint is running a Cortex XDR agent 7.0 or later release.not enforce device control on VDI endpoints.
- Mac—Ensure the endpoint is running a Cortex XDR agent 7.2 or later release.
- Linux—Cortex XDR device control is not supported on Linux endpoints.
To apply device control in organization, define device control profiles that determine which device types Cortex XDR blocks and which it permits. There are two types of profiles:
       Profile
    Description
      Configuration Profile
Allow or block these USB-connected device type groups:
- Disk Drives
- CD-Rom Drives
- Floppy Disk Drives
- (Windows only) Windows Portable Devices

2. Right-click to View Policy Details, Edit, Save as New, Disable, and Delete.
- STEP 6 | Monitor device control violations.
After apply Device Control rules in environment, use the Endpoints > Device Control Violations page to monitor all instances where end users attempted to connect restricted USB- connected devices and Cortex XDR blocked them on the endpoint. All violation logs are displayed on the page. sort the results, and use the filters menu to narrow down the results. For each violation event Cortex XDR logs the event details, the platform, and the device details that are available.
If see a violation for which you’d like to define an exception on the device that triggered it, right- click the violation and select one of the following options:
- Add device to permanent exceptions—To ensure this device is always allowed in network, select this option to add the device to the Device Permanent Exceptions list.
- Add device to temporary exceptions—To allow this device only temporarily on the selected endpoint or on all endpoints, select this option and set the allowed time frame for the device.
- Allow device to a profile exception—Select this option to allow the device within an existing Device Exceptions profile.
- STEP 7 | Tune device control exceptions.
To better deploy device control in network and allow further granularity, add devices on network to allow list and grant them access to endpoints. Device control exceptions are configured per device and must select the device category, vendor, and type of permission that want to allow on the endpoint. Optionally, to limit the exception to a specific device, also include the product and/or serial number.
Cortex XDR enables to configure the following exceptions:
  Exception Name
    Description
     Permanent Exceptions
  Permanent exceptions approve the device in network across all Device Control policies and profiles. create them directly from the violation event that blocked the device, or through the Permanent Exceptions list.
Permanent exceptions apply across platforms, allowing the deceives on all operating systems.

 Add a Custom Device Class
(Windows only) include custom USB-connected device classes beyond Disk Drive, CD-ROM, Windows Portable Devices and Floppy Disk Drives, such as USB connected network adapters. When create a custom device class, must supply Cortex XDR the official ClassGuid identifier used by Microsoft. Alternatively, if configured a GUID value to a specific USB connected device, must use this value for the new device class. After add a custom device class, view it in Device Management and enforce any device control rules and exceptions on this device class.
To create a custom USB-connected device class:
- STEP 1 | Go to Endpoints > Policy Management > Settings > Device Management. This is the list of all custom USB-connected devices.
- STEP 2 | Create the new device class.
Select +New Device. Set a Name for the new device class, supply a valid and unique GUID Identifier.
For each GUID value define one class type only.


  STEP 3 | Save.
The new device class is now available in Cortex XDR as all other device classes.
Host Firewall
The Cortex XDR host firewall enables to control communications on endpoints. To use the host firewall, set rules that allow or block the traffic on the devices and apply them to endpoints using Cortex XDR host firewall policy rules. Additionally, configure different sets of rules based on the current location of endpoints - within or outside organization network. The Cortex XDR host firewall rules leverage the operating system firewall APIs and enforce them on endpoints.
Before start applying host firewall policy rules, ensure meet the following requirements and refer to these known limitations:
- For Windows:
 154

 - The endpoint is running a Cortex XDR agent 7.1 or later release
- apply Cortex XDR host firewall rules to both incoming and outgoing communication on the
endpoint.
- For Mac:
- The endpoint is running a Cortex XDR agent 7.2 or later release.
- apply Cortex XDR host firewall rules only to incoming communication on the endpoint.
-not configure the following Mac host firewall settings with the Cortex XDR host firewall:
- Automatically allow built-in software to receive incoming connections. - Automatically allow downloaded signed software to receive incoming
connections.
The Cortex XDR Host firewall is not supported on Linux endpoints.
To configure the Cortex XDR host firewall in network, follow this high-level workflow:
- Enable Network Location Configuration
- Add a New Host Firewall Profile
- Apply Host Firewall Profiles to Endpoints
- Monitor the Host Firewall Activity on Endpoint
Enable Network Location Configuration
If want to apply location based host firewall rules, must first enable network location configuration in Agent Settings Profile.
When enabled, Cortex XDR performs the following to determine the endpoint location:
1. A domain controller (DC) connectivity test to check whether the device is connected to the internal network or not. If the device is connected to the internal network, then it is in the organization. Otherwise, if the DC test failed or returned an external domain, Cortex XDR proceeds to a DNS connectivity test.
2. In the DNS test, the Cortex XDR agent submits a DNS name that is known only to the internal network. If the DNS returned the pre-configured internal IP, then the device is within the organization. Otherwise, if the DNS IP cannot be resolved, then the device is located outside.
In every heartbeat, and if the Cortex XDR agent detects a network change on the endpoint, the agent triggers the device location test and re-calculates the policy according to the new location.
Add a New Host Firewall Profile
- STEP 1 | Log in to Cortex XDR.
Go to Endpoints > Policy Management > Extensions Profiles and select + New Profile. Select the
Platform and click Host Firewall > Next
- STEP 2 | Fill-in the general information for the new profile.
- Assign a name and an optional description to the profile.
- By default, host firewall profile rules are based on the current location of device. Configure
two sets of rules: a set of External Rules that apply when the device is located outside the internal organization network, and a set of Internal Rules that apply when the device is located within the internal organization network. If disable the Location Based option, policy will apply the internal set of rules only, and that will be applied to the device regardless of its location.

- STEP 3 | Create host firewall rules. For Windows:
Click +New Rule. A host firewall rule allows or blocks the communication to and/or from a Windows endpoint. fine tune the rule by applying the action to the following parameters:
- Action—Select whether to Allow or Block the communication on the endpoint.
- Specific IPs and Ports—(Optional) Configure the rule for specific local or remote IPs and/or Ports. also set a range of IP addresses.
- Direction—Select the direction of the communication this rule applies to:
- Inbound—Communication to the endpoint.
- Outbound—Communication from the endpoint.
- Both—The rule applies to both inbound and outbound communication.
- Protocol—(Optional) Select a specific protocol want this rule to apply to.
- Path—(Optional) Enter the full path and name of a program want the rule to apply to. If use
system variables in the path definition, must re-enforce the policy on the endpoint every time the directories and/or system variables on the endpoint change.
If the profile is location based, define both internal and external rules. also copy a rule from one set to another.
For Mac:

  1. Enable Host Firewall Management.
Enable this option to allow Cortex XDR to manage the host firewall on Mac endpoints.
2. Configure the host firewall internal and external settings.
The host firewall settings allow or block inbound communication on Mac endpoints. fine tune the rule by applying the action to the following parameters:
- Enable stealth mode—Hide mac endpoint from all TCP and UDP networks by enabling the Apple Stealth mode on endpoint.
- Block all incoming connections—Select where to block all incoming communications on the endpoint or not.
- Application exclusions—Allow or block specific programs running on the endpoint using Apple BundleID.
If the profile is location based, define both internal and external settings. STEP 4 | Save profile.
When you’re done, Create host firewall profile. STEP 5 | Apply Host Firewall Profiles to Endpoints.

 Apply Host Firewall Profiles to Endpoints
After defined the required host firewall profiles, must configure the Protection Policies and enforce them on endpoints. Cortex XDR applies Protection policies on endpoints from top to bottom, as you’ve ordered them on the page. The first policy that matches the endpoint is applied. If no policies match, the default policy that enables all communication to and form the endpoint is applied.
- STEP 1 | Log in to Cortex XDR.
Go to Endpoints > Policy Management > Extensions Policy Rules > +New Policy.
- STEP 2 | Configure settings for the host firewall policy.
1. Assign a policy name and optional description.
The platform will automatically be assigned to Windows.
2. Assign the host firewall profile want to use in this rule.
3. If desired, assign Device Configuration and/or Device Exceptions and or Host Firewall profiles. If
none are assigned, the default profiles will be applied.
4. ClickNext.
5. Select the target endpoints on which to enforce the policy.
Use filters or manual endpoint selection to define the exact target endpoints of the policy rules.
6. ClickDone.
Alternatively, associate the host firewall profile to an existing policy. Right-click the policy and select Edit. Select the Host Firewall profile and click Next. If needed, edit other settings in the rule (such as target endpoints, description, etc.) When you’re done, click Done
- STEP 3 | Configure policy hierarchy.
Drag and drop the policies in the desired order of execution.
- STEP 4 | Save the policy hierarchy.
After the policy is saved and applied to the agents, Cortex XDR enforces the host firewall policies on
environment.
Monitor the Host Firewall Activity on Endpoint
T to view only the communication events on the endpoint to which the Cortex XDR host firewall rules were applied, run the Cytool firewall show command.
Additionally, to monitor the communication on endpoint, use the following operating system utilities:
- Windows—Since the Cortex XDR Host Firewall leverages the Microsoft Windows Filtering Platform (WFP), use a monitoring tool such as Network Shell (netsh), the Microsoft Windows command- line utility to monitor the network communication on the endpoint.
- Mac—From the endpoint System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Firewall > Firewall options, view the list of blocked and allowed applications in the firewall. The Cortex XDR host firewall blocks only incoming communications on Mac endpoints, still allowing outbound communication initiated from the endpoint.

View host inventory and existing vulnerabilities
With Host insights Vulnerability management identify and quantify security vulnerabilities for applications installed on endpoints in network. Cortex XDR provides a Host inventory that lists all applications installed on each endpoint, detects the presence of existing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), and retrieves the latest data for each CVE from the NIST National Vulnerability Database to help with analysis and prioritization.
Use vulnerability management to easily mitigate and patch vulnerabilities on endpoints in network. See Hardened Endpoint Security for the list of all operating systems that support
Vulnerability Management.
Host Inventory and Vulnerability Management
In Add-ons > Host Insights > Vulnerability Management detect existing vulnerabilities, the Cortex XDR agent provides Cortex XDR a host inventory with the name and version of all applications installed on the endpoint. Every four hours, Cortex XDR correlates the network application inventory with the data from the NIST public database. If Cortex XDR detects a new CVE during data correlation, it creates an alert and generates an incident in Cortex XDR (only one alert per CVE). The alerts help proactively identify new risks in network, so that follow-up and remediate them, and associate other alerts with security patching problems in organization.
Additionally, use Cortex XDR to evaluate the extent and severity of each CVE in network, gain full visibility in to the risks to which each endpoint is exposed, and assess the vulnerability status of an installed application in network.

 Cortex XDR Indicators
When identify a threat, define specific indicators for which want Cortex XDR to raise alerts. define rules for the following types of indicators:
- Behavioral indicators of compromise (BIOCs)—Identifying threats based on their behaviors can be quite complex. As identify specific network, process, file, or registry activity that indicates a threat, create BIOCs that can alert when the behavior is detected. See Working with BIOCs.
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs)—Known artifacts that are considered malicious or suspicious. IOCs are static and based on criteria such as SHA256 hashes, IP addresses and domains, file names, and paths. create IOC rules based on information that gather from various threat-intelligence feeds or that gather as a result of an investigation within Cortex XDR. See Working with IOCs.
After create an indicator rule, Manage Existing Indicators from Cortex XDR. Working with BIOCs
Behavioral indicators of compromise (BIOCs) enable to alert and respond to behaviors—tactics, techniques, and procedures. Instead of hashes and other traditional indicators of compromise, BIOC rules detect the behavior of processes, registry, files, and network activity.
To enable to take advantage of the latest threat research, Cortex XDR automatically receives preconfigured rules from Palo Alto Networks. These global rules are delivered to all tenants with content updates. In cases where need to override a global BIOC rule, disable it or set a rule exception. also configure additional BIOC rules as investigate threats on network and endpoints. BIOC rules are highly customizable: create a BIOC rule that is simple or quite complex.
As soon as create or enable a BIOC rule, the app begins to monitor input feeds for matches. Cortex XDR also analyzes historical data collected in the Cortex Data Lake. Whenever there is a match, or hit, on a BIOC rule, Cortex XDR logs an Cortex XDR Alerts.
To further enhance the BIOC rule capabilities, also configure BIOC rules as custom prevention rules and incorporate them with Restrictions profiles. Cortex XDR can then raise behavioral threat prevention alerts based on custom prevention rules in addition to the BIOC detection alerts.

- Import Rules
Create a Rule from Scratch
To define a BIOC, configure the entity and any related activity or characteristics. An entity can be a specific process, registry, file, network host. An entity activity can describe the various actions that are relevant to that type of entity.Inc.

 For example, for a Registry entity, the actions are: Write, Rename, and Delete. If identify a threat by additional attributes, also specify those characteristics as additional entity information in the BIOC. For example, for a Process, add a process name, command-line argument used to call the process, or a user name.
The following describes the type of process and actions create a BIOC rule for:
- Event Log—Events relating to Windows Event Log.
- File—Events relating to file create, write, read, and rename according to the file name and path.
- Image Load—Events relating to module IDs of processes.
- Network—Events relating to incoming and outgoing network, filed IP addresses, port, host name, and
protocol.
- New Generation (NG) Network—Events relating to a combination of firewall and endpoint logs over the
network.
- Process—Events relating to execution and injection of a process name, hash, path, and CMD
- Registry— Events relating to registry write, rename and delete according to registry path.
To create a BIOC rule:
- STEP 1 | From Cortex XDR, select Rules > BIOC.
- STEP 2 | Select + Add Rule.
- STEP 3 | Configure the BIOC criteria.
Define any relevant activity or characteristics for the entity type. Creating a new BIOC rule is similar to the way that create a search with Query Builder.
- STEP 4 | Test BIOC rule.
Rules that do not refine enough can create thousands of alerts. As a result, it is highly recommended that test the behavior of a new or edited BIOC rule before save it. For example, if a rule will return thousands of hits because negated a single parameter, it is a good idea to test the rule before save it and make it active.
Cortex XDR automatically disables BIOC rules that reach 5000 or more hits over a 24 hour period.
When test the rule, Cortex XDR immediately searches for rule matches across all Cortex Data Lake data. If there are surprises, now is the time to see them and adjust the rule definition.
For the purpose of showing the expected behavior of the rule before save it, Cortex XDR tests the BIOC on historical logs. After save a BIOC rule, it will operate on both historical logs (up to 10,000 hits) and new data received from log sensors.
- STEP 5 | Save BIOC rule.
- STEP 6 | Define BIOC properties.
1. Enter a descriptive Name to identify the BIOC rule.
2. Specify the SEVERITY want to associate with the alert.
3. Select a rule TYPE which describes the activity.
4. (Optional) Select the MITRE Tactic and MITRE Technique want to associate with the alert. You
can select up to 3 MITRE Tactics and MITRE Techniques/Sub-Techniques.
5. Enter any additional comments such as why created the BIOC.
6. ClickOK.Inc.

- STEP 7 | Save BIOC rule.
Configure a Custom Prevention Rule
Custom prevention rules allow to configure and apply user-defined BIOC rules to Restriction profiles deployed on Windows, Mac, and Linux endpoints.
By using the BIOC rules, configure custom prevention rules to terminate the causality chain of a malicious process according to the defined Restrictions Profile Action Mode; Block, Report, Prompt, Disable and trigger Cortex XDR Agent behavioral prevention type alerts in addition to the BIOC rule detection alerts.
For example, configured a BIOC Process event rule as a custom preventions rule and applied it to Restrictions profile Demo. The action mode for Restriction profile Demo is set to Block. After the Restriction profile is deployed on endpoints, the custom prevention rule can begin to:
- Block a process at the endpoint level according to the defined rule properties.
- Trigger a behavioral prevention alert monitor and investigate in the Alerts table.
Before configure a BIOC rule as a custom prevention rule, make sure created a Restriction Profile for each type of operating system (OS) in environment that would like to deploy prevention rules on.
To configure a BIOC rule as a prevention rule:
- STEP 1 | In the BIOC Rule table, from the Source field, filter and locate a user-defined rule want to apply as a custom prevention rule. only apply a BIOC rule that created either from scratch or a Cortex XDR Global Rule template that meets the following criteria:
- The user-defined BIOC rule event does not include the following field configurations:
- All Events—Host Name
- File Event—Device Type, Device Serial Number
- Process Event—Device Type, Device Serial Number
- Registry Event—Country, Raw Packet
- BIOC rules with OS scope definitions must align with the Restrictions profile OS.
- When defining the Process criteria for a user-defined BIOC rule event type, select to run
only on actor, causality, and OS actor on Windows, and causality and OS actor on Linux and Mac.
- STEP 2 | Test BIOC rule.
Rules that do not refine enough can create thousands of alerts. As a result, it is highly recommended that test the behavior of a new or edited BIOC rule before save it. Cortex XDR automatically disables BIOC rules that reach 5000 or more hits over a 24 hour period.
- STEP 3 | Right-click and select Add to restrictions profile.
If the rule is already referenced by one or more profiles, select See profiles to view the profile names.
- STEP 4 | In the Add to Restrictions Profile pop-up:
- Ensure the rule selected is compatible with the type of endpoint operating system.
- Select the Restriction Profile name want to apply the BIOC rule to for each of the operating
systems. BIOC event rules of type Event Log and Registry are only supported by Windows OS. only add to existing profiles created, Cortex XDR Default profiles will not
appear as an option.Inc.

- STEP 5 | Add the BIOC rule to the selected profiles.
The BIOC rule is now configured as a custom prevention rule and applied to Restriction profiles. After the Restriction profile is pushed to endpoints, the custom prevention rule can start triggering behavioral prevention type alerts.
- STEP 6 | Review and edit custom prevention rules.

Working with IOCs
IOCs provide the ability to alert on known malicious objects on endpoints across the organization. load IOC lists from various threat-intelligence sources into the Cortex XDR app or define them individually. define the following types of IOCs:
- Full path
- File name
- Domain
- Destination IP address
- MD5 hash
- SHA256 hash
After define or load IOCs, the app checks for matches in the endpoint data collected from Cortex XDR agents. Checks are both retroactive and ongoing: The app looks for IOC matches in all data collected in the past and continues to evaluate new any new data it receives in the future.
Alerts for IOCs are identified by a source type of IOC (see Cortex XDR Alerts for more information).

               SOURCE
     User who created this IOC, or the file name from which it was created, or one of the following keywords:
- Public API—the indicator was uploaded using the Insert Simple Indicators, CSV or Insert Simple Indicators, JSON REST APIs.
- XSOAR TIM—the indicator was retrieved from XSOAR.
            There are two options for creating new IOC rules:
- Configure a single IOC.
- Upload a file, one IOC per line, that contains up to 20,000 IOCs. For example, upload multiple
file paths and MD5 hashes for an IOC rule. To help format the upload file in the syntax that Cortex XDR will accept, download the example file.Inc.

  If have a Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint license, upload IOCs using REST APIs in either CSV or JSON format.
- STEP 1 | From Cortex XDR, select Rules > IOC. STEP 2 | Select + Add IOC.
- STEP 3 | Configure the IOC criteria.
If after investigating a threat, identify a malicious artifact, create an alert for the Single IOC right away.
1. Configure the INDICATOR value on which want to match.
2. Configure the IOC TYPE. Options are Full Path, File Name, Domain, Destination IP, and MD5 or
SHA256 Hash.
3. Configure the SEVERITY want to associate with an alert for the IOC: Informational, Low,

Domain, Destination IP, and MD5 or SHA256 Hash.
5. ClickUpload.
- STEP 4 | (Optional) Define any expiration criteria for IOC rules.
If desired, also configure additional expiration criteria per IOC type to apply to all IOC rules.
In most cases, IOC types like Destination IP or Host Name are considered malicious only for a short period of time since they are soon cleaned and then used by legitimate services, from which time they only cause false positives. For these types of IOCs, set a short expiration period. The expiration criteria define for an IOC type will apply to all existing rules and additional rules that create in the future.
1. SelectSettings.
2. Set the expiration for any relevant IOC type. Options are Never, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, or 6

- Research a Known Threat
Cortex XDR Query Builder
The Query Builder is a powerful search tool at the heart of Cortex XDR that use to investigate any lead quickly, expose the root cause of an alert, perform damage assessment, and hunt for threats from data sources. With Query Builder, build complex queries for entities and entity attributes so that surface and identify connections between them. The Query Builder searches the raw data and logs stored in Cortex Data Lake and Cortex XDR for the entities and attributes specify and returns up to 100,000 results.
The Query Builder provides queries for the following types of entities:
- Process—Search on process execution and injection by process name, hash, path, command-line arguments, and more. See Create a Process Query.
- File—Search on file creation and modification activity by file name and path. See Create a File Query.
- Network—Search network activity by IP address, port, host name, protocol, and more. See Create a
Network Query.
- Registry—Search on registry creation and modification activity by key, key value, path, and data. See
Create a Registry Query.
- Event Log—Search Windows event logs by username, log event ID, log level, and message. See Create an
Event Log Query.
  188

 - NG Network—Search security event logs by firewall logs, endpoint raw data over network. See Create an NG Network Query.
- All Actions—Search across all network, registry, file, and process activity by endpoint or process. See Query Across All Entities.
The Query Builder also provides flexibility for both on-demand query generation and scheduled queries. Native Search
To search across all available logs and data in Cortex XDR, use the text-based Native Search. To facilitate simple and complex text-based queries, enter fields based on the log’s metadata hierarchy (core fields, vendor fields, or log types) the operator, the field value, and the timeframe. For simplicity,
the Native Search provides auto-completion—based on the known log fields—as type. also use Regex (except for with IP addresses and ranges) and wildcards in queries and can string together multiple queries using and or or.
For examples of text-based queries, see Native Search Examples.
Core Fields for Native Search
When specify core fields without any other search criteria, the Native Search queries the field value across all data and logs that contain that field type. To further refine the results and specify context, combine core fields with other criteria such as vendor or log type. build queries in Native Search for any of the following core fields:
- ip
- source_ip
- destination_ip - hash
- host_name
- user_name
- process_name - process_path
Vendor Fields for Native Search
To search for logs or data from a specific vendor, refine query by vendor and product. The query fields are hierarchical. To construct a query, separate each field in the hierarchy with periods. Examples of vendor fields include:Inc.

Search for Files on Endpoints use the text-based Native Search to search for files on endpoints. Unlike the Cortex XDR File Query which queries only the EDR data reported back from the agent, File Search initiates a search on the endpoint local files database, and can include deleted files as well. use file search to search for files by hash or path, on all Windows endpoints. File Search is a stand-alone query in Cortex XDR, andnot combine File Search with other queries or core fields in Native Search.
The Cortex XDR agent does not include in the local files inventory the following:
- Information about files that existed on the endpoint and were deleted before the Cortex XDR agent was installed.
- Information about files where the file size exceeds the maximum file size for hash calculations that is preconfigured in Cortex XDR.
- If the agent settings profile on the endpoint is configured to monitor common file types only, then the local files inventory includes information about these file types only.not search or destroy file types that are not included in the list of common file types.
- STEP 1 | From Cortex XDR > Investigation > Query Builder, select Native Search.
- STEP 2 | Enter search query in the following format:
<Action name> <Action mandatory parameters> <Action optional parameter>
- To search for all existing instances of a file:
- <Action name>—find_existing_files
- <Action mandatory parameters>—Search according to file hash or file path  enter
the full path, or enter a partial path using ‘*’).
- <Action optional parameter> narrow down the search to a specific host
by adding HOSTNAME = <hostname> or to multiple hosts by adding HOSTNAME in <hostname1, hostname2>.
For example,
find_existing_files path=c:\windows\system32\ping.exe and hostname=ADI-PC
- To search for all existing and deleted instances of a file:
- <Action name>—find_existing_or_deleted_files
- <Action mandatory parameters> search by file hash only.
- <Action optional parameter> narrow down the search to a specific host
by adding HOSTNAME = <hostname> or to multiple hosts by adding HOSTNAME in <hostname1, hostname2>.
For example:Inc.

  find_existing_or_deleted_files sha256=2867450a7f720c207b95492458c19acc7fe3183a84b4db48b637e65ad816f635 and hostname in PC
- STEP 3 | Run the search.
- STEP 4 | Review the search results in real-time.
The file search results include the following details: search query, counters indicating the number of endpoints that were searched, and a detailed list of all the file instances that were found. If not all endpoints in the query scope are connected or the search has not completed, the search continues and the search action remains in Pending status in the Action Center.
- The search query syntax.
- Counters indicating the number of connected and disconnected endpoints on which Cortex XDR
performed the search.
- Counters indicating the number of endpoints where the file currently exists and the number of
endpoints where the file does not exist.
- A detailed list of all the file instances that were found in the search. track and manage the search in the Action Center. STEP 5 | (Optional) Retrieve the file from the endpoint.
Right-click the file and select Get file to upload the file to Cortex XDR for further examination before destroy it.
- STEP 6 | (Optional) Destroy the file on the endpoint.
When destroy a file, permanently remove it. destroy the file directly from the search
results. Right-click the file and select Destroy By path or Destroy by hash.

 Investigate Incidents
An attack event can affect several users or hosts and raise different types of alerts caused by a single event. track incidents, assign analysts to investigate, and document the resolution. For a record log of all
actions taken by analysts in the incident, see Monitor Administrative Activity. Use the following steps to investigate an incident:
- STEP 1 | Select Incidents.
- STEP 2 | From the Incidents table, locate the incident want to investigate.
There are several ways filter or sort incidents:
- In the Status column for New incidents to view only the incidents that have not yet been investigated.
- In the Severity column, identify the incidents with the highest threat impact.
- In the Incident Sources column, filter according to the sources that raised the alerts which make up
the incident.
After locate an incident want to investigate, right-click it and select View Incident.
The Incident details page aggregates all alerts, insights, and affected assets and artifacts from those alerts in a single location. From the Incident details page manage the alert and investigate an event within the context and scope of a threat. Select the pencil icon to edit the incident name and description.
- STEP 3 | Assign an incident to an analyst.Inc.

 Select the assignee (or Unassigned in the case of a new incident) below the incident description and begin typing the analyst’s email address for automated suggestions. Users must have logged into the app to appear in the auto-generated list.
- STEP 4 | Assign an incident status.
Select the incident status to update the status from New to Under Investigation, or Resolved to
indicate which incidents have been reviewed and to filter by status in the incidents table.
- STEP 5 | Review the details of the incident, such as alerts and insights related to the event, and affected assets and artifacts.
- Investigate Key Artifacts.
Key Artifacts list files and file hashes, signers, processes, domains, and IP addresses that are related to the threat event. Each alert type contains certain key artifacts, and the app weighs and sorts alerts into Incidents based on the key artifacts. Different key artifacts have different weights according to their impact and case. The app analyzes the alert type, related causality chains, and key artifacts to determine which incident has the highest correlation with the alert, and the Cortex XDR app groups the alert with that incident.
The app also displays any available threat intelligence for the artifact. The Threat Intelligence column in the Key Artifacts panel lists the WildFire (WF) verdicts associated with each artifact and identifies any malware with a red malware icon. If also integrate additional threat intelligence, this section can also display VirusTotal (VT) scores and AutoFocus (AF) tags. For additional information, see External Integrations.
Right-click a file or process under Key Artifacts to view the entire artifact report from the threat intelligence source.
- ViewVirusTotalandAutoFocusreports.
- Add to Allow List. Artifacts added to the allow list are displayed with
- Add to Block List. Artifacts added to the block list are displayed with
- Open Hash View to display detailed information about the files and processes relating to the hash.
- Open IP Address View to display detailed information about the Ip address.
- Investigate Key Assets.
Key Assets identify the scope of endpoints and users affected by the threat. Right-click an asset to
Filter Alerts by that asset and Open Asset View to display the host insights.
- InvestigateAlerts.
Incidents are created through high or medium severity alerts. Low severity Analytics alerts sometime also create an incident. Low and informational severity alerts are categorized as Insights and are available on the Insights tab. In the incident, review the alerts and, if additional context is required, review the related insights. also view high, medium, and low severity alerts in the main Alerts table.
During investigation, also perform additional management of alerts, which include:
- Analyze an Alert
- View the Alert Causality
- Timeline View
- Copy Alerts
- Build an Alert Exclusion Policy from Alerts in an Incident
- Intiate a remediation analysisInc.

- STEP 6 | (Optional) Take action on the incident.
- Change the incident severity.
The default severity is based on the highest alert in the incident. To manually change the severity select Actions > Change Incident Severity and choose the new severity. The smaller severity bubble indicates the original severity.
- Change the incident status.
Select Actions > Change Incident Status to update the status from New to Under Investigation.
- Create an exclusion.

Triage Alerts
When the Cortex XDR app displays a new alert on the Alerts page, use the following steps to investigate and triage the alert:
- STEP 1 | Review the data shown in the alert such as the command-line arguments (CMD), process info, etc.
For more information about the alert fields, see Cortex XDR Alerts. STEP 2 | Analyze the chain of execution in the Causality View.
When the app correlates an alert with additional endpoint data, the Alerts table displays a green dot
to the left of the alert row to indicate the alert is eligible for analysis in the Causality View. If the alert has a gray dot, the alert is not eligible for analysis in the Causality View. This can occur when there is no data collected for an event, or the app has not yet finished processing the EDR data. To view the reason analysis is not available, hover over the gray dot.
- STEP 3 | Review the Timeline View of review the sequence of events over time. The timeline is available for alerts that have been stitched with endpoint data.
- STEP 4 | If deemed malicious, consider responding by isolating the endpoint from the network.Inc.

- STEP 5 | Remediate the endpoint and return the endpoint from isolation.
- STEP 6 | Inspect the information again to identify any behavioral details that use to Create a
BIOC Rule.
If create a BIOC rule, test and tune the logic for the rule, and then save it.

 Analyze an Alert
To help understand the full context of an alert, Cortex XDR provides a powerful analysis view that empowers to make a thorough analysis very quickly.
The Causality View is available for XDR agent alerts that are based on endpoint data and for alerts raised on network traffic logs that have been stitched with endpoint data.
To view the analysis:
- STEP 1 | From the Alerts page, locate the alert want to analyze.
- STEP 2 | Right-click anywhere in the alert, and select Analyze. Cortex XDR opens the alert in the Causality View.
- STEP 3 | Review the chain of execution and available data for the process and, if available, navigate through the processes tree.
Create Profile Exceptions
Quickly create exception for Window processes, BTP, and JAVA deserialization alerts directly from the Alerts table.
- STEP 1 | Right-click an alert of source XDR Agent, category Exploit, and select Create alert exception. Cortex XDR opens a Create Alert Exception window detailing the exception parameters.
- STEP 2 | Select an Exception Scope:
- Global - Applies the exception across organization.
- Profile - Select an existing profile or click and enter a Profile Name to create a new profile.
- STEP 3 | Add.
- STEP 4 | (Optional) View profile exceptions.
1. Navigate to Endpoints > Policy Management > Profiles.
2. In the Profiles table, locate the OS in which created global or profile exception and right-
click to view or edit the exception properties.
View Generating BIOC Rule

- STEP 1 | From the Alerts page, locate alerts with Alert Sources: XDR BIOC and XDR IOC.
- STEP 2 | Right-click the row, and select View generating rule.
Cortex XDR opens the BIOC rule that generated the alert in the BIOC Rules page. If the rule has been
deleted, an empty table is displayed.
- STEP 3 | Review the rule, if necessary, right-click to perform available actions.
Retrieve Additional Alert Details
To easily access additional information relating to an alert:
- STEP 1 | From the Alerts page, locate the alert for which want to retrieve information.Inc.

- STEP 2 | Right-click anywhere in the alert, and select one of the following options:
- Retrieve alert data—Cortex XDR can provide additional analysis of the memory contents when an exploit protection module raises an XDR Alert. To perform the analysis must first retrieve alert data consisting of the memory contents at the time the alert was raised. This can be done manually for a specific alert, or enable Cortex XDR to automatically retrieve alert data for every relevant XDR Alert. After Cortex XDR receives the data and performs the analysis, it issues a verdict for the alert. monitor the retrieval and analysis progress from the Action Center (pivot to view Additional data). When analysis is complete, Cortex XDR displays the verdict in the Advanced Analysis field.
- Retrieve related files—To further examine files that are involved in an alert, request the Cortex XDR agent send them to the Cortex XDR management console. If multiple files are involved, Cortex XDR supports up to 20 files and 200MB in total size. The agent collects all requested files into one archive and includes a log in JSON format containing additional status information. When the files are successfully uploaded, download them from the Action Center for up to one week.
- View full endpoint details—Jump to a filtered view of the Endpoint Administration page by endpoint ID. This unique ID is assigned by the Cortex XDR agent to identify the endpoint.
- STEP 3 | Navigate to Response > Action Center to view retrieval status. Alert Exclusions
The Alert Exclusions page displays all alert exclusions in Cortex XDR.
An alert exclusion is a policy that contains a set of alert match criteria that want to suppress from Cortex XDR. Add an Alert Exclusion Policy from scratch or base the exclusion off of alerts that investigate in an incident. After create an exclusion policy, Cortex XDR hides any future alerts that match the criteria from incidents and search query results. If choose to apply the policy to historic results as well as future alerts, the app identifies any historic alerts as grayed out.
The following table describes both the default fields and additional optional fields that add to the alert exclusions table and lists the fields in alphabetical order.
   Field
    Description
        BACKWARD SCAN STATUS
     Exclusion policy status for historic data, either enabled if want to apply the policy to previous alerts or disabled if don’t want to apply the policy to previous alerts.

                      Add an Alert Exclusion Policy
Through the process of triaging alerts or resolving an incident, determine a specific alert does not indicate a threat. If do not want Cortex XDR to display alerts that match certain criteria, create an alert exclusion policy. After create an exclusion policy, Cortex XDR hides any future alerts that match the criteria, and excludes the alerts from incidents and search query results. If choose to apply the policy to historic results as well as future alerts, the app identifies any historic alerts as grayed out.
If an incident contains only alerts with exclusions, Cortex XDR changes the incident status to Resolved - False Positive and sends an email notification to the incident assignee (if set).
There are two ways to create an exclusion policy. define the exclusion criteria when investigate an incident or create an alert exclusion from scratch.
- Build an Alert Exclusion Policy from Alerts in an Incident
- Build an Alert Exclusion Policy from Scratch
Build an Alert Exclusion Policy from Alerts in an Incident
If after reviewing the incident details, if want to suppress one or more alerts from appearing in the future, create an exclusion policy based on the alerts in the incident. When create an incident from the incident view, define the criteria based on the alerts in the incident. If desired, also Create Alert Exclusions from scratch.
- STEP 1 | From the Incident view in Cortex XDR, select Actions > Create Exclusion Policy.
- STEP 2 | Enter a POLICY NAME to identify alert exclusion.
- STEP 3 | Enter a descriptive COMMENT that identifies the reason or purpose of the alert exclusion policy.
- STEP 4 | Use the alert filters to add any the match criteria for the alert exclusion policy. also right-click a specific value in the alert to add it as match criteria. The app refreshes to show which alerts in the incident would be excluded. To see all matching alerts including those not related to the incident, clear the option to Show only alerts in the named incident.Inc.

  STEP 5 | Create the exclusion policy and confirm the action.
If later need to make changes, view, modify, or delete the exclusion policy from the
Incidents > Alert Exclusions page.
Build an Alert Exclusion Policy from Scratch
Select Incidents > Exclusions.
Select + Add Exclusion Policy.
Enter a Policy Name to identify the exclusion policy.
Enter any comments to explain the purpose or intent behind the policy.
Define the exclusion criteria.
Use either the filters at the top to build exclusion criteria. Or, to use existing alert values to
populate exclusion criteria, right click the value, and select Add rows with <value> to policy. As define the criteria, the app filters the results to display matches.
Review the results.
The alerts in the table will be excluded from appearing in the app after the policy is created and optionally, any existing alert matches will be grayed out.
This action is irreversible: All historic excluded alerts will remain excluded if disable or delete the policy.
Create and then select Yes to confirm the alert exception policy. Causality View
The Causality View provides a powerful way to analyze and respond to alerts. The scope of the Causality View is the Causality Instance (CI) to which this alert pertains. The Causality View presents the alert (generated by Cortex XDR or sent to Cortex XDR from a supported alert source such as the Cortex XDR agent) and includes the entire process execution chain that led up to the alert. On each node in the CI chain, Cortex XDR provides information to help understand what happened around the alert.Inc.
- STEP 1 | STEP 2 | STEP 3 | STEP 4 | STEP 5 |
- STEP 6 |
- STEP 7 |

  The Causality View comprises five sections:
Context
Summarizes information about the alert are analyzing, including the host name, the process name on which the alert was raised, and the host IP and MAC address . For alerts raised on endpoint data or activity, this section also displays the endpoint connectivity status and operating system.
Causality Instance Chain
Includes the graphical representation of the Causality Instance (CI) along with other information and capabilities to enable to conduct analysis.
The Causality View presents a single CI chain. The CI chain is built from processes nodes, events, and alerts. The chain presents the process execution and might also include events that these processes caused and alerts that were triggered on the events or processes. The Causality Group Owner (CGO) is displayed on the left side of the chain. The CGO is the process that is responsible for all the other processes, events and alerts in the chain. need the entire CI to fully understand why the alert occurred.
The Causality View provides an interactive way to view the CI chain for an alert. move it, extend it, and modify it. To adjust the appearance of the CI chain, enlarge/shrink the chain for easy viewing using the size controls on the right. also move the chain around by selecting and dragging it. To

Inc.

  Cortex XDR presents the Timeline in four parts:
  Section
    Description
     CGO (and process instances that are part of the CGO)
 Cortex XDR displays the Causality Group Owner (CGO) and the host on which the CGO ran in the top left of the timeline. The CGO is the parent process in the execution chain that Cortex XDR identified as being responsible for initiating the process tree. In the example above, wscript.exe is the CGO and the host it ran on was HOST488497. also click the blue corner of the CGO to view and filter related processes from the Timeline. This will add or remove the process and related events or alerts associated with the process from the Timeline.
     Timespan
     By default, Cortex XDR displays a 24-hour period from the start of the investigation and displays the start and end time of the CGO at either end of the timescale. move the slide bar to the left or right to focus on any time-gap within the timescale. also use the time filters above the table to focus on set time periods.
      Activity
Depending on the type of activities involved in the CI chain of events, the activity section can present any of the following three lanes across the page:
- Alerts—The alert icon indicates when the alert occurred.
- BIOCs—The category of the alert is displayed on the left (for
example: tampering or lateral movement). Each BIOC event also indicates a color associated with the alert severity. An informational severity can indicate something interesting has happened but there weren’t any triggered alerts. These events are likely benign but are byproducts of the actual issue.
- Event information—The event types include process execution, outgoing or incoming connections, failed connections, data upload, and data download. Process execution and connections are indicated by a dot. One dot indicates one connection while many dotsInc.

   Section
   Description
    indicates multiple connections. Uploads and Downloads are indicated by a bar graph that shows the size of the upload and download.
The lanes depict when activity occurred and provide additional statistics that can help investigate. For BIOC and Alerts, the lanes also depict activity nodes—highlighted with their severity color: high (red), medium (yellow), low (blue), or informational (gray)—and provide additional information about the activity when hover over the node.
      Related events, alerts, and informational BIOCs
    Cortex XDR displays all the alerts, BIOCs (triggered and informational), and events a in this table. Clicking on a node in the activity area of the Timeline filters the results see here. Similar to other pages in Cortex XDR, create filters to search for specific events.
 Analytics Alert View
The analytics alert view provides a detailed summary of the behavior that triggered an Analytics or Analytics BIOC alert. This view also provides a visual depiction of the behavior and additional information use to assess the alert. This includes the endpoint on which the activity was initiated, the user that performed the action, the technique the analytics engine observed, and activity and interactions with other hosts inside or outside of network.

 Retrieve Files from an Endpoint
If during investigation want to retrieve files from one or more endpoints, initiate a files retrieval request from Cortex XDR.
For each files retrieval request, Cortex XDR supports up to:
- 20 files
- 500MB in total size
- 10 different endpoints
The request instructs the agent to locate the files on the endpoint and upload them to Cortex XDR. The agent collects all requested files into one archive and includes a log in JSON format containing additional status information. When the files are successfully uploaded, download them from the Action Center.
To retrieve files from one or more endpoints:
- STEP 1 | Log in to Cortex XDR.
Go to Response > Action Center > + New Action.
- STEP 2 | Select Files Retrieval and click Next.
- STEP 3 | Select the operating system and enter the paths for the files want to retrieve, pressing ADD after each completed path.not define a path using environment variables on Mac and Linux endpoints.

Scan an Endpoint for Malware

Cortex XDR agent can scan Windows and Mac endpoints and attached removable drives for dormant malware that is not actively attempting to run.

The Cortex XDR agent examines the files on the endpoint according to the `Malware security profile` that is in effect on the endpoint (quarantine settings, unknown file upload, etc.)

When a malicious file is detected during the scan, the Cortex XDR agent reports the malware to Cortex XDR so that manually take additional action to remove the malware before it is triggered and attempts to harm the endpoint.

scan the endpoint in the following ways:
- System scan—Initiate a full scan on demand from Endpoints Administration for an endpoint. To initiate a system scan, see Initiate a Full Scan from Cortex XDR
- Periodic scan—Configure periodic full scans that run on the endpoint as part of the malware security profile. To configure periodic scans, see Add a New Malware Security Profile.
- Custom scan—(Windows, requires a Cortex XDR agent 7.1 or later release) The end user can initiate a scan on demand to examine a specific file or folder. For more information, see the Cortex XDR agent administrator’s guide for Windows.
Initiate a Full Scan from Cortex XDR initiate full scans of one or more endpoints from either Endpoint Administration or the Action Center. After initiating a scan, monitor the progress from Response > Action Center. From both locations, also abort an in-progress scan. The time a scan takes to complete depends on the number of endpoints, connectivity to those endpoints, and the number of files for which Cortex XDR needs to obtain verdicts.
To initiate a scan from Cortex XDR:Inc.

- STEP 1 | Log in to Cortex XDR.
Select Response > Action Center > +New Action.
- STEP 2 | Select Malware Scan.
- STEP 3 | Click Next.
- STEP 4 | Select the target endpoints (up to 100) on which want to scan for malware.
Scanning is available on Windows and Mac endpoints only. Cortex XDR automatically filters out any
endpoints for which scanning is not supported. Scanning is also not available for inactive endpoints.
If needed, Filter the list of endpoints by attribute or group name.
- STEP 5 | Click Next.
- STEP 6 | Review the action summary and click Done when finished.
Cortex XDR initiates the action at the next heart beat and sends the request to the agent to initiate a malware scan.
- STEP 7 | To track the status of a scan, return to the Action Center.

 Investigate Files
- Manage File Execution
- Manage Quarantined Files
- Review WildFire Analysis Details
- Investigate Hash View
Manage File Execution manage file execution on endpoints using file hashes included in allow and block lists. If trust a certain file and know it to be benign, add the file hash to the allow list and allow it to be executed on all endpoints regardless of the WildFire or local analysis verdict. Similarly, if want to always block a file from running on any of endpoints, add the associated hash to the block list. Adding files to the block list or allow list takes precedence of any other policy rules that may have otherwise been applied to these files. In the Action Center in Cortex XDR, monitor block list and allow list actions performed in networks and add/remove file from these lists.

- Open in Quick Launcher—Open the quick launcher search results for the hash.Inc.

  Manage Quarantined Files
When the Cortex XDR agent detects malware on a Windows endpoint, take additional precautions to quarantine the file. When the Cortex XDR agent quarantines malware, it moves the file from the location on a local or removable drive to a local quarantine folder (%PROGRAMDATA%\Cyvera\Quarantine) where it isolates the file. This prevents the file from attempting to run again from the same path or causing any harm to endpoints.
To evaluate whether an executable file is considered malicious, the Cortex XDR agent calculates a verdict using information from the following sources in order of priority:
- Hash exception policy
- WildFire threat intelligence
- Local analysis
Quarantining a file in Cortex XDR can be done in one of two ways:
- enable the Cortex XDR agent to automatically quarantine malicious executables by configuring quarantine settings in the Malware security profile.
- quarantine a specific file from the causality card.
- STEP 1 | View the quarantined files in network.Inc.

 Navigate to Response > Action Center > Quarantine. Toggle between DETAILED and AGGREGATED BY SHA256 views to display information on quarantined files.

If want to prevent Cortex XDR from initiating Live Terminal remote sessions on an endpoint running the Cortex XDR agent, disable this capability during agent installation or later on through Cortex XDR Endpoint Administration. Disabling script execution is irreversible. If later want to re-enable this capability on the endpoint, must re-install the Cortex XDR agent.
Disabling Live Terminal does not take effect on sessions that are in progress.

#### Isolate an Endpoint

> This capability is supported on Windows endpoints with Traps agent 6.0 and later releases.

When isolate an endpoint, halt all network access on the endpoint except for traffic to Cortex XDR.
- This can prevent a compromised endpoint from communicating with other endpoints thereby reducing an attacker’s mobility on network.
- Cortex XDR agent receives the instruction to isolate the endpoint and carries out the action
- the <kbd>Cortex XDR console</kbd> shows an <kbd>Isolated check-in status</kbd>.
- To ensure an endpoint remains in isolation, agent upgrades are not available for isolated endpoints.

> For VDI sessions, using the network isolation response action can disrupt communication with the VDI host management system thereby halting access to the VDI session.
> As a result, before using the response action must add the VDI processes and corresponding IP addresses to allow list in the Agent Settings profile (Response Actions > Allow List of Network Isolation).

- STEP 1 | From Cortex XDR, initiate an action to isolate an endpoint.
  - Go to <kbd>Response > Action Center > + New Action</kbd> and select Isolate.
  - also initiate the action (for one or more endpoints) from the Isolation page of the <kbd>Action Center</kbd> or from <kbd>Endpoints > Endpoint Management > Endpoint Administration</kbd>.

- STEP 2 | STEP 3 |
- STEP 4 | STEP 5 |
- STEP 6 | STEP 7 |
Select Isolate.
Enter a Comment to provide additional background or other information that explains why you
isolated the endpoint.
After isolate an endpoint, Cortex XDR will display the Isolation Comment on the Action Center >
Isolation. If needed, edit the comment from the right-click pivot menu. Click Next.
Select the target endpoint that want to isolate from network.
If needed, Filter the list of endpoints. To learn how to use the Cortex XDR filters, refer to Filter Page Results.
Click Next.
Review the action summary and click Done when finished.
 In the next heart beat, the agent will receive the isolation request from Cortex XDR.
- STEP 8 | To track the status of an isolation action, select Response > Action Center > Isolation.
If after initiating an isolation action, want to cancel, right-click the action and select Cancel for pending endpoint. cancel the isolation action only if the endpoint is still in Pending status and has not been isolated yet.
- STEP 9 | After remediate the endpoint, cancel endpoint isolation to resume normal communication. cancel isolation from the Actions Center (Isolation page) or from Endpoints > Endpoint Management > Endpoint Administration. From either place right-click the endpoint and select Endpoint Control > Cancel Endpoint Isolation.
Remediate Endpoints
When investigating suspicious incidents and causality chains often need to restore and revert changes made to endpoints as part of a malicious activity. To avoid manually searching for the affected files and registry keys on endpoints, run an automated Cortex XDR remediation analysis on endpoint.
Cortex XDR remediation analysis investigates suspicious causality process chains and incidents on endpoints and displays a list of suggested files and registry keys to remediate. From the Cortex XDR remediation suggestions, select the specific files and registry keys to remediate, reverting any changes that occurred during the malicious activity.
To initiate a remediation analysis, must meet the following requirements:
- Pro per Endpoint license
- An App Administrator, Privileged Responder, or Privileged Security Admin role permissions which
include the remediation permissions
- EDR data collection enabled
- Agent version 7.1 and above on Windows endpoints
- STEP 1 | Initiate a remediation suggestions analysis.
- In the Incident View, navigate to Actions > Remediation Suggestions.Inc.

 Hosts that are part of the incident view and do not meet the required criteria will not be included in the remediation analysis.
- In the Causality View, either:
- Right-click any process node involved in the causality chain and select Remediation Suggestion.
- Navigate to Actions > Remediation Suggestions.
Cortex XDR opens the Remediation Suggestions pop-up. The analysis can take a few minutes,
choose to minimize the pop-up while navigating to other Cortex XDR pages.
- STEP 2 | Review the remediation suggestions.
In the Remediation Suggestions page, review the:
- Status of the remediation scan—In Progress or Completed
- Name of the scanned incident or process.
- Number of remediation suggestions found and when the scan completed.

Run Scripts on an Endpoint
For enhanced endpoint remediation and endpoint management, run Python 3.7 scripts on endpoints directly from Cortex XDR. For commonly used actions, Cortex XDR provides pre-canned scripts use out-of-the-box. also write and upload own Python scripts and code snippets into Cortex XDR for custom actions. Cortex XDR enables to manage, run, and track the script execution on the endpoints, as well as store and display the execution results per endpoint.
The following are pre-requisites to executing scripts on endpoints:
- Cortex XDR Pro Per Endpoint license
- Endpoints running the Cortex XDR agent 7.1 and later releases. Since the agent uses its built-in
capabilities and many available Python modules to execute the scripts, no additional setup is required on
the endpoint.
- Role in the hub with the following permissions to run and configure scripts:
- Run Standard scripts
- Run High-risk scripts
 280

 - Script configuration (required to upload a new script, run a snippet, and edit an existing script)
- Scripts (required to view the Scripts Library and the script execution results)
Running snippets requires both Run High-risk scripts and Script configuration permissions. Additionally, all scripts are executed as System User on the endpoint.
Use the following work flow to start running scripts on endpoints:
- Manage All Scripts in the Scripts Library
- Upload Scripts
- Run a Script on Endpoints
- Track Script Execution and View Results
- Troubleshoot Script Execution
- Disable Script Execution
Manage All Scripts in the Scripts Library
All scripts are available in the Action Center > Scripts Library, including pre-canned scripts provided by Palo Alto Networks and custom scripts that uploaded. From the Scripts Library, view the script code and meta data.
The following table describes both the default and additional optional fields that view in the Scripts Library per script. The fields are in alphabetical order.

   Retrieve a Registry value from the endpoint.
     *registry_set
(Windows)
    Set a Registry value from the endpoint.
  *Since all scripts are running under System context,not perform any Registry operations on user-specific hives (HKEY_CURRENT_USER of a specific user).
Upload Scripts write and upload additional scripts to the Scripts Library.Inc.

 To upload a new script:
- STEP 1 | From Action Center > Scripts Library select +New Script.
 Drag and drop script file, or browse and select it. During the upload, Cortex XDR parses script to ensure are using only Python modules supported by Cortex XDR. Click Supported Modules if want to view the supported modules list. If script is using unsupported Python modules, or if script is not using proper indentation, Cortex XDR will require that fix it. use the editor to update script directly in Cortex XDR.
- STEP 2 | Add meta-data to script. fill-in the fields manually, and also upload an existing definitions file in the supported format to automatically fill-in some or all of the definition. To view the manifest format and create own, see Creating a Script Manifest.
- General—The general script definitions include: name and description, risk categorization, supported operating systems, and timeout in seconds.
 - Input—Set the starting execution point of script code. To execute the script line by line, select Just run. Alternatively, to set a specific function in the code as the entry point, select Run by entry point. Select the function from the list, and specify for each function parameter its type.Inc.

  - Output—If script returns an output, Cortex XDR displays that information in the script results table.
- Single parameter—If the script returns a single parameter, select the Output type from the list and the output will be displayed as is. To detect the type automatically, select Auto Detect.
- Dictionary—If the script returns more than a single value, select Dictionary from the Output type list. By default, Cortex XDR displays in the script results table the dictionary value as is. To improve the script results table display and be able to filter according to the returned value, assign a user friendly name and type to some or all of dictionary keys, and Cortex XDR will use that in the results table instead.
To retrieve files from the endpoint, add to the dictionary the files_to_get key to include an array of paths from which files on the endpoint will be retrieved from the endpoint.
- STEP 3 | When are done, Create the new script. The new script is uploaded to the Scripts Library.Inc.

 Creating a Script Manifest
The script manifest file upload into Cortex XDR has to be a single-line textual file, in the exact format explained below. If file is structured differently, the manifest validation will fail and will be required to fix the file.
For the purpose of this example, we are showing each parameter in a new line. However, when create file, must remove any \n or \t characters.
This is an example of the manifest file structure and content:
  {
"name":"script name", "description":"script description", "outcome":"High Risk|Standard", "platform":"Windows,macOS,Linux", "timeout":600, "entry_point":"entry_point_name", "entry_point_definition":{
"input_params":[ {"name":"registry_hkey","type":"string"}, {"name":"registry_key_path","type":"number"}, {"name":"registry_value","type":"number"}],
"output_params":{"type":"JSON","value":[ {"name":"output_auto_detect","friendly_name":"name1","type":"auto_detect"}, {"name":"output_boolean","friendly_name":"name2","type":"boolean"}, {"name":"output_number","friendly_name":"name3","type":"number}, {"name":"output_string","friendly_name":"name4","type":"string"}, {"name":"output_ip","friendly_name":"name5","type":"ip"}]
} }
 Always use lower case for variable names.
- STEP 1 | Fill-in the script name and description. use letters and digits. Avoid the use of special characters.
- STEP 2 | Categorize the script.
If a script is potentially harmful, set it as High— Risk to limit the user roles that can run it. Otherwise,
set it as Standard. STEP 3 | Assign the platform.
Enter the name of the operating system this script supports. The options are Windows, macOS, and Linux. If need to define more than one, use a comma as a separator.
- STEP 4 | Set the script timeout.
Enter the number of seconds after which Cortex XDR agent halts the script execution on the endpoint.
- STEP 5 | Configure the script input and output.
To Run by entry point, must specify the entry point name, and all input and output definitions. The available parameter types are:
- auto_detectInc.

 - boolean - number - string - ip
- number_list - string_list - ip_list
To set the script to Just run, leave both Entry_point and Entry_point_definitions empty:
 {
"name":"scrpit name", "description":"script description", "outcome":"High Risk|Standard", "platform":"Windows,macOS,Linux", "timeout":600,
"entry_point":"", "entry_point_definition":{}
}
Run a Script on Endpoints
Follow this high-level workflow to run scripts on endpoints that perform actions, or retrieve files and data from the endpoint back to Cortex XDR.
- STEP 1 | Initiate a new action to run a script.
From Action Center > +New Action, select Run Script.
- STEP 2 | Select an existing script or add a code snippet.
1. To run an existing script, start typing the script name or description in the search field, or scroll down and select it from the list. Set the script timeout in seconds and any other script parameters, if they exist. Click Next
2. Alternatively, insert a Code Snippet. Unlike scripts, snippets are not saved in the Cortex XDR Scripts Library and cannot receive input or output definitions. Write snippet in the editor, fill-in the timeout in seconds, and click Next
- STEP 3 | Select the target endpoints.
Select the target endpoints on which to execute the script. When you’re done, click Next.
- STEP 4 | Review the summary and run script.
Cortex XDR displays the summary of the script execution action. If all the details are correct, Run the script and proceed to Track Script Execution and View Results. Alternatively, to track the script execution progress on all endpoints and view the results in real-time, Run in interactive mode.
Run Scripts in Interactive Mode
When need to run several scripts on the same target scope of endpoints, or when want to view and inspect the results of those scripts immediately and interactively, run scripts in Interactive Mode. also initiate interactive mode for an endpoint directly from Endpoints Management. In
this mode, Cortex XDR enables to track the execution progress on all endpoints in real-time, run more scripts or code snippets as go, and view the results of these scripts all in one place.Inc.

  In Interactive Mode, Cortex XDR displays general information that includes the scope of target endpoints and a list of all the scripts that are being executed in this session. For each script on the executed scripts list, view the following:
- The script name, date and time the script execution action was initiated, and a list of input parameters.
- A progress bar that indicates in real-time the number of endpoints for which the script execution is In
Progress, Failed, or Completed. When hover over the progress bar, drill-down for more information about the different sub-statuses included in each group. Similarly, also view this information on the scripts list to the left in the form of a pie chart that is dynamically updated per script as it is being executed.
Cortex XDR does not include disconnected endpoints in the visualization of the script execution progress bar or pie chart. If a disconnected endpoint later gets connected, Cortex XDR will execute the script on that endpoint and the graphic indicators will change accordingly to reflect the additional run and its status.
- Dynamic script results that are continuously updated throughout the script execution progress. Cortex XDR lists the results, and graphically aggregates results only if they have a small variety of values. When both views are available, switch between them.
While in Interactive Mode, continuously execute more scripts and add code snippets that will be immediately executed on the target endpoints scope. Cortex XDR logs all the scripts and code snippets execute in Interactive Mode, and later view them in the Action Center.
- To add another script, select the script from the Cortex XDR scripts library, or start typing a Code Snippet. Set the script timeout and input parameters as necessary, and Run when are done. The script is added to the executed scripts list and its runtime data is immediately displayed on screen.
Track Script Execution and View Results
After run a script, see the script execution action in the Action Center.Inc.

  From the Action Center,:
- Track Script Execution Status
- Cancel or Abort Script Execution
- View Script Execution Results
- Open Script Interactive Mode
- Rerun a Script
Track Script Execution Status
All script execution actions are logged in the Action Center. The Status indicates the action progress, which includes the general action status and the breakdown by endpoints included in the action. The following table lists the possible status of a script execution action for each endpoint, in alphabetical order:
  Status
    Description
  Aborted
Completed Successfully
The script execution action was aborted after it was already In Progress on the endpoint.
The script was executed successfully on the endpoint with no exceptions.
     Canceled
     The script execution action was canceled from Cortex XDR before the Cortex XDR agent pulled the request from the server.
       Expired
     Script execution actions expire after four days. After an action expires, the status of any remaining Pending actions on endpoints change to Expired and these endpoints will not receive the action.
     Failed
   A script can fail due to these reasons:
- The Cortex XDR agent failed to execute the script.
- Exceptions occurred during the script execution.
To understand why the script execution failed, see Troubleshoot Script Execution.
  In Progress
The Cortex XDR agent pulled the script execution request.
   288

   Status
    Description
  Pending The Cortex XDR agent has not yet pulled the script execution request from the Cortex XDR server.
Timeout The script execution reached its configured time out and the Cortex XDR agent stopped the execution on the endpoint.
Cancel or Abort Script Execution
Depending on the current status of the script execution action on the target endpoints, cancel or abort the action for Pending and In Progress actions:
- When the script execution action is Pending, the Cortex XDR agent has not pulled the request yet from Cortex XDR. Whencel a pending action, the Cortex XDR server pulls back the pending request and updates the action status as Canceled. To cancel the action for all pending endpoints, go to the Action Center, right-click the action and Cancel for pending endpoints. Alternatively, to cancel a pending action for specific endpoints only, go to Action Center > Additional data > Detailed Results, right-click the endpoint(s) and Cancel pending action
- When the script execution action is In Progress, the Cortex XDR agent has begun running the script on the endpoint. When abort an in progress action, the Cortex XDR agent halts the script execution on the endpoint and updates the action status as Aborted. To abort the action for all In Progress endpoints and cancel the action for any Pending endpoints, go to the Action Center, right-click the action and Abort and cancel execution. Alternatively, to abort an in progress action for specific endpoints only, go to Action Center > Additional data > Detailed Results, right-click the endpoint(s) and Abort for endpoint in progress
View Script Execution Results
Cortex XDR logs all script execution actions, including the script results and specific parameters used in the run. To view the full details about the run, including returned values, right-click the script and select Additional data.
The script results are divided into two sections. On the upper bar, Cortex XDR displays the script meta-data that includes the script name and entry point, the script execution action status, the parameter values used in this run and the target endpoints scope. also download the exact code used in this run as a py file.
In the main view, Cortex XDR displays the script execution results in two formats:
- Aggregated results—A visualization of the script results. Cortex XDR automatically aggregates only results that have a small variety of values. To see how many of the script results were aggregated successfully, see the counts on the toggle (for example, aggregated results 4/5). filter the results to adjust the endpoints considered in the aggregation. also generate a PDF report of the aggregated results view.Inc.
     Pending Abort
     The Cortex XDR agent is in the process of executing the script, and has not pulled the abort request from the Cortex XDR server yet.

  - Main results view—A detailed table listing all target endpoints and their details.
 In addition the endpoint details (name, IP, domain, etc), the following table describes both the default and additional optional fields that view per endpoint. The fields are in alphabetical order.
  Field
    Description
     *Returned values
 If script returned values, the values are also listed in the additional data table according to script output definitions.
     Execution timestamp
     The date and time the Cortex XDR agent started the script execution on the endpoint. If the execution has not started yet, this field is empty.
  Failed files The number of files the Cortex XDR agent failed to retrieve from the endpoint.
   290

   Field
    Description
     Retention date
   The date after which the retrieved file will no longer be available for download in Cortex XDR. The value is 90 days from the execution date.
  Retrieved files
Status
Standard output
The number of files the Cortex XDR successfully retrieved from the endpoint.
See the list of statuses and their descriptions in Track Script Execution Status.
The returned stdout
          For each endpoint, right-click and download the script stdout, download retrieved files if there are any, and view returned exceptions if there are any. also Export to file to download the detailed results table in TSV format.
Open Script Interactive Mode
In Interactive Mode, Cortex XDR enables to dynamically track the script execution progress on all target endpoints and view the results as they are being received in real-time. Additionally, start executing more scripts on the same scope of target endpoints.
To initiate Interactive Mode for an already running script:
- From the Action Center, right-click the execution action of the relevant script and select Open
in interactive mode. Rerun a Script
Cortex XDR allows to select a script execution action and rerun it. When rerun a script, Cortex XDR uses the same parameters values, target endpoints, and defined timeout that were defined for the previous run. However, if the target endpoints in the original run were defined using a filter, then that filter will be recalculated when rerun the script. Cortex XDR will use the current version of the script. If since the previous run the script has been deleted, or the supported operating system definition has been modified, will not be able to rerun the script.
To rerun a script:
- STEP 1 | From the Action Center, right-click the script want to rerun and select Rerun. are redirected to the final summary stage of the script execution action.
- STEP 2 | Run the script.
To run the script with the same parameters and on the same target endpoints as the previous run, click Done. To change any of the previous run definitions, navigate through the wizard and make the necessary changes. Then, click Done. The script execution action is added to the Action Center
Troubleshoot Script Execution
To understand why a script returned Failed execution status, do the following:
1. Check script exceptions—If the script generated exceptions, view them to learn why the script
execution failed. From the Action Center, right click the Failed script and select Additional data. InInc.

 the Script Results table, right-click an endpoint for which the script execution failed and select View exceptions. The Cortex XDR agent executes scripts on Windows endpoints as a SYSTEM user, and on Mac and Linux endpoints as a root user. These context differences could cause differences in behavior, for instance when using environment variables.
2. Validate custom scripts—When a custom script uploaded failed and the reason the script failed
is still unclear from the exceptions, or if the script did not generate any exceptions, try to identify whether it failed due to an error in Cortex XDR or due to an error in the script. To identify the error source, execute the script without the Cortex XDR agent on the same endpoint with regular Python 3.7 installation. If the script execution is unsuccessful, should fix script. Otherwise, if the script was executed successfully with no errors, please contact Palo Alto Networks support.
Disable Script Execution
If want prevent Cortex XDR from running scripts on a Cortex XDR agent, disable this capability during agent installation or later on through Cortex XDR Endpoint Administration. Disabling script execution is irreversible. If later want to re-enable this capability on the endpoint, must re-install the Cortex XDR agent. See the Cortex XDR Agent Administrator’s Guide for more information.
Disabling Script Execution does not take effect on scripts that are in progress.
Search and Destroy Malicious Files
To take immediate action on known and suspected malicious files, now search and destroy the files from the Cortex XDR management console. After identify the presence of the file, immediately destroy the file from any or all endpoints on which the file exists.
The Cortex XDR agent builds a local database on the endpoint with a list of all the files, including their path, hash, and additional metadata. Depending on the number of files and disk size of each endpoint, it can take a few days for Cortex XDR to complete the initial endpoint scan and to populate the files database.not search an endpoint until the initial scan is complete and all file hashes are calculated. After the initial scan is complete and the Cortex XDR agent retains a snapshot of the endpoint files inventory, the agent maintains the files database by initiating periodic scans and closely monitoring all actions performed on the files. search for specific files according to the file hash, the file full path, or a partial path using regex parameters from the Action Center or the Query Builder. After find the file, quickly select it in the search results and destroy the file by hash or by path. also destroy a file from the Action Center, without performing a search, if know the path or hash. When destroy a file by hash, all the file instances on the endpoint are removed.
The Cortex XDR agent does not include in the local files inventory the following:
- Information about files that existed on the endpoint and were deleted before the Cortex XDR agent was installed.
- Information about files where the file size exceeds the maximum file size for hash calculations that is preconfigured in Cortex XDR.
- If the agent settings profile on the endpoint is configured to monitor common file types only, then the local files inventory includes information about these file types only.not search or destroy file types that are not included in the list of common file types.
The following are prerequisites to enable Cortex XDR to search and destroy files on endpoints:
   292

 - Provision an active Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint license.
- Verify the Cortex XDR Host Insights add-on is enabled on tenant.
- Ensure that endpoints are running a Cortex XDR agent 7.2 or later release.
- Ensure the endpoint is running a supported Windows operating system.
- Ensure File Search and Destroy is enabled for Cortex XDR agent.
- Ensure Cortex XDR role in the hub has File search and Destroy files permissions.
Search a File search for files on the endpoint by file hash or file path. The search returns all instances of this file on the endpoint. then immediately proceed to destroy all the file instances on the endpoint, or upload the file to Cortex XDR for further investigation.
- To search for a file from the Query Builder, create a query using Native Search for Finding Files.
- To search for a file from the Action Center wizard:
- STEP 1 | STEP 2 |
- STEP 3 |
- STEP 4 |
- STEP 5 |
From the Action Center select +New Action > File Search. Configure the search method:
- To search by hash, enter the file SHA256 value. When search by hash, also search for deleted instances of this file on the endpoint.
- To search by path, enter the specific path for the file on the endpoint or specify the path using wildcards. When provide a partial path or partial file name using *, the search will return all the results that match the partial expression.
Click Next.
Select the target endpoints.
Select the target endpoints on which want to search for the file. Cortex XDR displays only endpoints eligible for file search. When you’re done, click Next.
Review the summary and initiate the search.
Cortex XDR displays the summary of the file search action.If need to change settings, go Back.
If all the details are correct, click Run. The File search action is added to the Action Center. Review the search results.
In the Action Center, monitor the action progress in real-time and view the search results for all target endpoints. For a detailed view of the results, right-click the action and select Additional data. Cortex XDR displays the search criteria, timestamp, and real-time status of the action on the target endpoints.:
- View results by file (default view)—Cortex XDR displays the first 100 instances of the file from every endpoint. Each search result includes details about the endpoint (such as endpoint status, name, IP address, and operating system) and details about the file instance (such as full file name and path, hash values, and creation and modification dates).
- View the results by endpoint—For each endpoint in the search results, Cortex XDR displays details about the endpoint (such as endpoint status, name, IP address, and operating system), the search action status, and details about the file (whether it exists on the endpoint or not, how many instances of the file exist on the endpoint, and the last time the action was updated).Inc.

  If not all endpoints in the query scope are connected or the search has not completed, the search action remains in Pending status in the Action Center.
- STEP 6 | (Optional) Destroy a file.
After located the malicious file instances on all endpoints, proceed to destroyall the file instances on the endpoint. From the search results Additional data, right-click the file to immediately Destroy by path, Destroy by hash, or Get file to upload it to Cortex XDR for further examination.
Destroy a File
When know a file is malicious, destroy all its instances on endpoints directly from Cortex XDR. destroy a file immediately from the File search action result, or initiate a new action from the Action Center. When destroy a file, the Cortex XDR agent deletes all the file instances on the endpoint.
- To destroy a file from the file search results, refer to Step 6 above. - To destroy a file from the Action Center wizard:
- STEP 1 | From the Action Center select +New Action > Destroy File.
- STEP 2 | To destroy by hash, provide the SHA25 of the file. To destroy by path, specify the exact file
path and file name. Click Next. STEP 3 | Select the target endpoints.
Select the target endpoints from which want to remove the file. Cortex XDR displays only endpoints eligible for file destroy. When you’re done, click Next.
- STEP 4 | Review the summary and initiate the action.
Cortex XDR displays the summary of the file destroy action. If need to change settings, go
Back. If all the details are correct, click Run. The File destroy action is added to the Action Center. Manage External Dynamic Lists
An External Dynamic List (EDL) is a text file hosted on an external web server that Palo Alto Networks firewall uses to provide control over user access to IP addresses and domains that the Cortex XDR has found to be associated with an alert.Inc.

Data Collector is deployed only within the ranges defined IP address ranges.
The Broker VM requires an SA account that has administrator privileges on all Windows workstations and servers in environment. Due to this, Cortex XDR recommends limit the number of users granted access to the SA account as it poses a credential compromise security threat.
  - User Name—User name used by Pathfinder to access broker VM.
- Password—Password used by Pathfinder to access broker VM.
Credentials are stored and encrypted only on the broker VM.
- Domain—Domain name of network.
- (Optional) Domain Suffixes—Domain suffixes required for DNS resolving within network.
The domain suffixes list is read-only and populated by defined Network Configurations.
- Authentication Method—Select either Kerberos or NTLM.

  When selecting Kerberos, the Broker has access to domain controllers over port 88 and is able to acquire the authentication ticket. It is recommended to use Kerberos for better security.

2. Look for WSMan operation EventDelivery completed successfully messages. These indicate events forwarded successfully.
Migrate Existing Windows Event Collector Certificate
For users who are running broker VM version 8.0 and later, and have already have a signed Windows Event Collector certificate, it’s best to migrate CA to the Cortex XDR console to better manage connection between the Windows Event Collector and Broker VM.
To migrate exiting Windows Event Collector signed certificate to the Cortex XDR console:
- STEP 1 | In Cortex XDR, navigate to Cortex XDR > Settings > Broker VMs table and locate broker VM.
- STEP 2 | Right click, select Applet Management > Windows Event Forwarder Migration. STEP 3 | In the Windows Event Forwarder Migration window:
1. Securely import the signed certificate and key from Linux server by copying and running in OpenSSL the Run Export Command. Make sure enter certificate and key file names.
2. Copy the auto-generated password. Provide the following password when running the OpenSSL command to authenticate import.
3. Upload CA Certificate by Drag and Drop or browse for certificate.
4. Upload certificate to the Cortex XDR console.
 PS C:\Users\Administrator> gpupdate /force
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Restart-Service WinRM
 PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WinEvent Microsoft-windows-WinRM/ operational -MaxEvents10

 Cortex XDR displays an Action Succeeded notification.
 After a successful migration, certificates are managed and signed by Cortex XDR.
It is recommended to delete the CA PFX file and private key from the secured host where the certificates were signed.
Set Up a Windows Event Collector
Use this workflow for Broker VM version 7.4.5 and earlier. For later Broker VM versions follow the process detailed in Activate the Windows Event Collector.
The Windows Event Collector (WEC) runs on the broker VM collecting event logs from Domain Controllers (DCs). To enable collection of the event logs, need to configure them as Windows Event Forwarders (WEFs), and establish trust between them and the WEC. Establishing trust between the WEFs and the WEC is achieved by mutual authentication over TLS using server and client certificates.
The WEF, a WinRM plugin, runs under the Network Service account. Therefore, need to provide the WEFs with the relevant certificates and grant the account access permissions to the private key used for client authentication, for example, authenticate with WEC.
Ensure meet the following prerequisites:
- Cortex XDR Pro per TB license
- have knowledge of Windows Active Directory and Domain Controllers.
- have openssl installed on a secure Linux or macOS host.
- Broker VM supports a working DNS name resolution and valid DNS domain zone records.
- DCs are running on Windows Server 2012 or later.
- STEP 1 | Generate CA and WEC certificates.
1. On secure Linux/macOS host, download the scripts and save each of the following files to the
  same directory:
- generate_certs.sh - openssl.conf


 - v3.ext
 The CA, WEC, and WEF private keys are generated on this host. Ensure are working on a secure host and store the CA private key securely with password protection, so are able to generate WEF certificates for any DC would want to turn into a WEF in the future.
2. Set execution permission on generate_certs.sh file by running: $ chmod +x generate_certs.sh
3. Run the script, providing the broker VM CN, as registered in the DNS, on which the WEC will be activated. will be prompted for a password to protect the PFX file.
If are running the script for the first time, use the --create-ca flag to also generate the CA certificate.
   $ ./generate_certs.sh --create-ca --cn broker.etac-tlv.local
Creating the CA
It is recommended to protect the CA certificate/key pair from overriding/ deleting it unintentionally. Set readOnly permissions? [y/n] y

this is not the case - upload the CA file which will be used to validate the DCs' client certificate in the CA BUNDLE field.
4. On successful activation, copy the displayed subscription URL.
- STEP 3 | Generate the WEF certificate.
1. In secure Linux/macOS host, run the script using the copied subscription URL:
  $ ./generate_certs.sh --cn ETAC-DC-2016.etac-tlv.local

 Analytics Concepts
Network security professionals know that safeguarding a network requires a defense-in-depth strategy. This layered approach to network security means ensuring that software is always patched and current, while running hardware and software systems that are designed to keep attackers out. Many strategies exist to keep unwanted users out of a network, most of these work by stopping intrusion attempts at the network perimeter.
As good and necessary as those strategies and products are, they all can defend only against known threats. Systems that looks for malicious software, for example, traditionally do its work based on previously identified MD5 signatures. But authors of these viruses constantly make trivial modifications to these signatures of the virus to avoid virus scanners until their MD5 database is updated with the modified and newly discovered signatures.
In other words, defensive network systems are constantly trying to keep up with the best efforts of aggressive, nimble attackers. defensive network software must be 100% correct 100% of the time to prevent successful attacks. A determined attacker, on the other hand, must be successful only once to ruin day.
Consequently, network defense-in-depth strategy must include software and processes that are designed to detect and respond to an intruder who has successfully penetrated systems. This is the position that Cortex XDR takes in enterprise. The app efficiently and automatically identifies abnormal activity on network while providing with the exact information need to rapidly evaluate potential threats and then isolate and remove those threats from network before they can perform real damage.

Analytics Engine
The Cortex XDR app uses an analytics engine to examine logs and data from sensors. The analytics engine retrieves logs from Cortex Data Lake to understand the normal behavior (creates a baseline) so that it can raise alerts when abnormal activity occurs. The analytics engine accesses logs as they are streamed to Cortex Data Lake and analyzes the data as soon as it arrives. Cortex XDR raises an Analytics alert when the analytics engine determines an anomaly.
The analytics engine is built to process—in parallel—large amounts of data stored in Cortex Data Lake. The ultimate goal is to identify normal behavior so the Cortex apps can recognize and use alerts to notify of that abnormal behavior. The analytics engine can examine traffic and data from a variety of sources such as network activity from firewall logs, VPN logs (from Prisma Access from the Panorama plugin), endpoint activity data (on Windows endpoints), Active Directory or a combination of those sources, to identify endpoints and users on network. After endpoints and users are identified, the analytics engine collects relevant details about every asset that it sees based on the information it obtains from the logs. The analytics engine can detect threats from only network data or only endpoint data, but for more context when investigating an alert, a combination of data sources are recommended.
The list of what the engine looks for is large, varied, and constantly growing but, as a consequence of this analysis, the analytics engine is able to build profiles about every endpoint and user of which it knows about. Profiles allow the engine to put the activity of the endpoint or user in context by comparing it against similar endpoints or users. The analytics engine creates and maintains a very large number of profile types but, generally, they can all be placed into three categories.

 Analytics Sensors
To detect anomalous behavior, Cortex XDR can analyze logs and data from a variety of sensors.
  Sensor
    Description
  Palo Alto Networks sensors
     Firewall traffic logs
     Palo Alto Networks Firewalls perform traditional and next- generation firewall activities. The Cortex XDR analytics engine can analyze Palo Alto Networks firewall logs to obtain intelligence about the traffic on network. A Palo Alto Networks firewall can also enforce Security policy based on IP addresses and domains associated with Analytics alerts with external dynamic lists.
     Enhanced application logs (EAL)
 To provide greater coverage and accuracy, enable enhanced application logging on Palo Alto Networks firewalls. EAL are collected by the firewall to increase visibility into network activity for Palo Alto Networks apps and services, like Cortex XDR. Only firewalls sending logs to Cortex Data Lake can generate enhanced application logs.
Examples of the types of data that enhanced application logs gather includes records of DNS queries, the HTTP header User Agent field that specifies the web browser or tool used to access a URL, and information about DHCP automatic IP address assignment. With DHCP information, for example, Cortex XDR can alert on unusual activity based on hostname instead of IP address. This allows the security analyst using Cortex XDR to meaningfully assess whether the user’s activity is within the scope of his or her role, and if not, to more quickly take action to stop the activity.
     GlobalProtect and Prisma Access logs
     If use GlobalProtect or Prisma Access to extend firewall security coverage to mobile users, Cortex XDR can also analyze VPN traffic to detect anomalous behavior on mobile endpoints.
     Firewall URL logs (part of firewall threat logs)
   Palo Alto Networks firewalls can log Threat log entries
when traffic matches one of the Security Profiles attached to a security rule on the firewall. Cortex XDR can analyze entries for Threat logs relating to URLs and raise alerts that indicate malicious behavior such as command and control and exfiltration.
      Cortex XDR agent endpoint data
With a Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint license, deploy Cortex XDR agents on endpoints to protect them from malware and software exploits. The analytics engine can also analyze the EDR data collected by the Cortex XDR agent
to raise alerts. To collect EDR data, must install Cortex XDR agent 6.0 or a later release on Windows endpoints (Windows 7 SP1 or later).


   Sensor
   Description
      The Cortex XDR analytics engine can analyze activity and traffic based solely on endpoint activity data sent from Cortex XDR agents. For increased coverage and greater insight during investigations, use a combination of Cortex XDR agent data and firewalls to supply activity logs for analysis.
      Pathfinder data collector
 In a firewall-only deployment where the Cortex XDR agent is not installed on endpoints, use of Pathfinder to monitor endpoints. Pathfinder scans unmanaged hosts, servers, and workstations for malicious activity. The analytics engine can also analyze Pathfinder the data collector in combination with other data sources to increase coverage of network and endpoints, and to provide more context when investigating alerts.
     Directory Sync logs
     If use the Directory Sync service to provide Cortex XDR with Active Directory data, the analytics engine can also raise alerts on Active Directory logs.
  External sensors
     Third-party firewall logs
   If use non-Palo Alto Networks firewalls—Check Point, Fortinet, Cisco ASA—or in addition to or instead of Palo
Alto Networks firewalls, set up a syslog collector
to facilitate log and alert ingestion. By sending firewall logs to Cortex XDR, increase detection coverage and take advantage of Cortex XDR analysis capabilities. When Cortex XDR analyzes firewall logs and detects anomalous behavior, it raises an alert.
     Third-party authentication service logs
     If use an authentication service—Microsoft Azure AD, Okta, or PingOne set up log collection to ingest authentication logs and data into authentication stories.
     Windows Event Collector logs
  The Windows Event Collector (WEC) runs on the broker VM collecting event logs from Domain Controllers (DCs). The analytics engine can analyze these event logs to raise alerts such as for credential access and defense evasion.
 Coverage of the MITRE Attack Tactics
Network attacks follow predictable patterns. If interfere with any portion of this pattern, the attack will be neutralized.


  The analytics engine can alert on any of the following attack tactics as defined by the MITRE ATT&CKTM knowledge base of tactics.
  Tactic
    Description
     Execution
 After attackers gain a foothold in network, they can use various techniques to execute malicious code on a local or remote endpoint.
The Cortex XDR app detects malware and grayware on network using a combination of network activity, Pathfinder data collector of unmanaged endpoints, endpoint data from Cortex XDR agents, and evaluation of suspicious files using the WildFire® cloud service.
     Persistence
     To carry out a malicious action, an attacker can try techniques that maintain access in a network or on an endpoint. An attacker can initiate configuration changes—such as a system restart or failure—that require the endpoint to restart a remote access tool or open a backdoor that allows the attacker to regain access on the endpoint.
     Discovery
   After an attacker has access to a part of network, discovery techniques to explore and identify subnets, and discover servers and the services that are hosted on those endpoints. The idea is to identify vulnerabilities within network.
The app detects attacks that use this tactic by looking for symptoms in internal network traffic such as changes in connectivity patterns that including increased rates of connections, failed connections, and port scans.
      Lateral Movement To expand the footprint inside network, and attacker uses lateral movement techniques
to obtain credentials to gain additional access to more data in the network.

   Tactic
   Description
      The analytics engine detects attacks during this phase by examining administrative operations (such as SSH, RDP, and HTTP), file share access, and user credential usage that is beyond the norm for network. Some of the symptoms the app looks for are increased administrative activity, SMB usage, and remote code execution.
      Command and Control
 The command and control tactic allows an attacker to remotely issue commands to and endpoint
and receive information from it. The analytics engine identifies intruders using this tactic by looking for anomalies in outbound connections, DNS lookups, and endpoint processes with bound ports. The app is looking for unexplained changes in the periodicity of connections and failed DNS lookups, changes in random DNS lookups, and other symptoms that suggest an attacker has gained initial control of a system.
     Exfiltration
    Exfiltration tactics are techniques to receive
data from a network, such as valuable enterprise data. The app seeks to identify it by examining outbound connections with a focus on the volume of data being transferred. Increases in this volume are an important symptom of data exfiltration.
 Analytics Detection Time Intervals
The analytics engine for Cortex XDR retrieves logs from Cortex Data Lake to understand the normal behavior (creates a baseline) so that it can raise alerts when abnormal activity occurs. This analysis is highly sophisticated and performed on more than a thousand dimensions of data. Internally, the Cortex XDR app organizes its analytics activity into algorithms called detectors. Each detector is responsible for raising an alert when worrisome behavior is detected.
To raise alerts, each detector compares the recent past behavior to the expected baseline by examining the data found in logs. A certain amount of log file time is required to establish a baseline and then a certain amount of recent log file time is required to identify what is currently happening in environment.
There are several meaningful time intervals for Cortex XDR Analytics detectors:
  Time Interval
    Description
      Learning Period
The shortest amount of log file time before the app can raise an alert. This is typically the time from when a detector first starts running and when see an alert but, in some cases, detectors pause after an upgrade as they enter a new learning period.

   Time Interval
   Description
    Most but not all detectors will wait until they have a <learning period> amount of time before they run. This learning period exists to give the detector enough data to establish a baseline, which in turn helps to avoid false positives.
The learning period is also referred to as the profiling or waiting period and, informally, it is also referred to as soak time.
      Test Period
     The amount of logging time that a detector uses to determine if unusual activity is occurring on network. The detector compares test period data to the baseline created during the training period, and uses that comparison to identify abnormal behavior.
     Training Period
 The amount of logging time that the detector requires to establish a baseline, and to identify the behavioral limits beyond which an alert is raised. Because network is not static in terms of
its topology or usage, detectors are constantly updating the baselines that they require for their analytics. For this update process, the training period is how far back in time the detector goes to update and tune the baseline.
This period is also referred to as the baseline period.
When establishing a baseline, detectors compute limits beyond which network activity will require an alert. In some cases, detectors do not compute baseline limits; instead they are predetermined
by Cortex XDR engineers. The engineers determine the values used for predetermined limits using statistical analysis of malicious activity recorded worldwide. The engineers routinely perform this statistical analysis and update the predetermined limits as needed with each release of the Cortex XDR.
      Deduplication Period
    The amount of time in which additional alerts for the same activity or behavior are suppressed before Cortex XDR raises another Analytics alert.

 About Asset Management
Network asset visibility is a crucial investigative tool in discovering rogue devices in network and preventing malicious activity. Understanding how many managed and unmanaged assets are part of network provides with vital information to better assess security exposure and track network communication.
Cortex XDR Asset Management provides an accurate representation of network assets by collecting and analyzing the following network resources:
- User-defined IP Address Ranges and Domain Names associated with internal network
- EDR data collected by Firewall Logs
- Cortex XDR Agent Logs
- Broker VM Network Mapper
- Pathfinder Data Collector
With the data aggregated by Cortex XDR Asset Management locate manage assets more
effectively and reduce the amount of research required to:
- Distinguish between assets managed and unmanaged by a Cortex XDR Agent.
- Identify assets that are part of internal network.
- Track network data communications from within and outside network.


 Configure Network Parameters
In order to track and identify assets in network, need to define internal IP address ranges and domain names to enable Cortex XDR to analyze, locate, and display assets.
Define IP Address Ranges
- STEP 1 | In Cortex XDR, navigate to Assets > Network Configuration > IP Address Ranges. STEP 2 | Define an IP Address Range
By default, Cortex XDR creates Private Network ranges that specify reserved industry approved ranges. Private Network ranges are marked with a icon and can only have the name edited.
To Add New Range select either:
- Create New
- In the Create IP Address Rage pop-up, enter the IP address Name and IP Address Range or CIDR values. add a range which is fully contained in an existing range, howevernot add a new range which partially intersect with another range.
The range names define will appear when investigating the network related events within the
Cortex XDR console.
- Save definitions.
- Upload from File
- In the Upload IP Address Ranges pop-up, drag and drop or search for a CSV file listing the IP address ranges. Download example file to view the correct format.
- Add list of IP address ranges. STEP 3 | Review IP address ranges.
After named and defined IP address ranges, review the following information:
   The IP Address Ranges table displays the following fields:
- Range Name—Name of the IP address range define.
- First IP Address—First IP address value of the defined range.

 - Last IP Address—Last IP address value of the defined range.
- Active Assets—Number of assets located within the defined range that are have reported Cortex
XDR Agent logs or appeared in Network Firewall Logs.
- Active Manged Assets—Number of assets located within the defined range that are reported Cortex
XDR Agent logs.
- Modified By—User name of user who last changed the range.
- Modification Time—Timestamp of when this range was last changed.
- STEP 4 | Manage IP address ranges.
In the IP Address Ranges table, locate range and select:
- Edit range—Edit the IP address configurations. Changes made will effect the Broker VM Network Mapper.
- Delete range—Delete the IP address range. Define Domain Names
- STEP 1 | In Cortex XDR, navigate to Assets > Network Configuration > Internal Domain Suffixes.
- STEP 2 | In the Internal Domain Suffixes section, +Add the domain suffix want to include as part of internal network. For example, acme.com.
- STEP 3 | Select   to add to the Domains List.


 Manage Network Assets
The Assets page provides a central location from which view and investigate information relating to assets in network. Using defined internal network configurations, Broker VM Network Mapper, Cortex XDR Agent, EDR data collected from Firewall logs, and Third-Party logs, Cortex XDR is able to aggregate and display a list of all the assets located within network according to their IP address.
To easily investigate assets:
- STEP 1 | Navigate to Assets > Asset Management > Assets.
- STEP 2 | In the Assets table, filter and review the following fields:
By default the table is filtered according to unmanaged assets over the last 7 days.
   Field
    Description

| Asset Management
                         AGENT ID
     ID of the agent installed on the asset. Cortex XDR only displays agents that send EDR data captured in the firewall logs.

- STEP 3 | Investigate an asset.
Locate an IP address, right-click and select to:
- Open asset view or —Pivot to the Asset View to view insights collected from the endpoint.
Insights are only available for assets managed by a Cortex XDR Agent, if the asset is unmanaged, select Open IP View to view details of the associated IP address.
- View agent details—Pivot to the Endpoints table filtered according to the agent ID. Only available for assets with Cortex XDR agent installed.
- Open in Quick Launcher—Open the Quick Launcher search results for the IP address.

 Monitor Cortex XDR Incidents
The Incidents table lists all incidents in the Cortex XDR app.
 An attack can affect several hosts or users and raises different alert types stemming from a single event. All artifacts, assets, and alerts from a threat event are gathered into an Incident.
The logic behind which alert the Cortex XDR app assigns to an incident is based on a set of rules which take into account different attributes. Examples of alert attributes include alert source, type, and time period. The app extracts a set of artifacts related to the threat event, listed in each alert, and compares it with the artifacts appearing in existing alerts in the system. Alerts on the same causality chain are grouped with the same incident if an open incident already exists. Otherwise, the new incoming alert will create
a new incident. The Incidents table displays all incidents including the incident severity to enable to prioritize, track, and update incidents. For additional insight into the entire scope and cause of an event, view all relevant assets, suspicious artifacts, and alerts within the incident details. also track incidents, document the resolution, and assign analysts to investigate and take remedial action. Select multiple incidents to take bulk actions on incidents.
The following table describes both the default and additional optional fields that view in the Incidents table and lists the fields in alphabetical order.

  - ![ip](https://i.imgur.com/E4LLA3v.png)

- STEP 2 | Settings > Integrations > External Applications.

- STEP 3 | In Syslog Servers, add a <kbd>+ New Server</kbd>.
  - ![ip](https://i.imgur.com/01E8dAP.png)

- STEP 4 | Define the <font color=red> Syslog server parameters </font>
  - ![configure](https://i.imgur.com/j3TvQpP.png)
  - Name — Unique name for the server profile.
  - Destination — <font color=blue> IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) </font> of the Syslog server.
  - Port — The port number on which <font color=blue> to send Syslog messages </font>
  - Facility
    - Choose one of the <font color=blue> Syslog standard values </font>
    - The value maps to how Syslog server uses the facility field to manage messages.
    - For details on the facility field, see RFC 5424.
  - Protocol — Select a method of communication with the Syslog server:
    - TCP — No validation is made on the connection with the Syslog server. However, if an error occurred with the domain used to make the connection, the Test connection will fail.
    - UDP — Cortex XDR runs a validation to ensure connection was made with the syslog server.
    - TCP + SSL — Cortex XDR validates the syslog server certificate and uses the certificate signature and public key to encrypt the data sent over the connection.
  - Certificate
    - The communication between **Cortex XDR** and the **Syslog destination** can use TLS.
    - Cortex XDR validates that the Syslog receiver has a certificate signed by either a `trusted root CA` or a `self signed certificate`.
     - If syslog receiver uses a `self signed CA`
       - Browse and upload Self Signed Syslog Receiver CA.
       - Make sure the `self signed CA` includes public key.
     - If only use a `trusted root CA`
       - leave the Certificate field empty.
  - Ignore Certificate Error
    - Cortex XDR does not recommend, but choose to select this option to ignore certificate errors if they occur.
    - This will forward alerts and logs even if the certificate contains errors.


- STEP 5 | <kbd>Test</kbd> the parameters to ensure a valid connection and <kbd>Create</kbd> when ready.
  - define up to five Syslog servers.
  - Upon success, the table displays the Syslog servers and their status.
  - ![Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 14.55.39](https://i.imgur.com/5lygz1T.png)

- STEP 6 | (Optional) Manage Syslog server connection.
  - In the Syslog Servers table
  - Locate Syslog server and right-click to <kbd>Send text message</kbd> to test the connection.
    - Cortex XDR sends a message to the defined Syslog server which check to see if the test message indeed arrived.
  - Locate the Status field.
    - The Status field displays a Valid or Invalid TCP connection.
    - Cortex XDR tests connection with the Syslog server every 10min.
    - If no connection is found after 1 hour, Cortex XDR send a notice to the Notification Center.

- STEP 7 | Configure Notification Forwarding.
  - After integrate with Syslog receiver, configure forwarding settings.


---

#### Configure Notification Forwarding
With Cortex XDR, choose to receive notifications to keep up with the alerts and events that matter to teams.

To forward notifications, create a forwarding configuration that specifies the log type want to forward.
- also add filters to configuration to send notifications that match specific criteria.
- Cortex XDR applies the filter only to future alerts and events.
- Use this workflow to configure notifications for `alerts, agent audit logs, and management audit logs`.
- To receive notifications about reports, see Create a Report from Scratch.

- STEP 1 | Settings > Notifications.
- STEP 2 | <kbd>+ Add Forwarding Configuration</kbd>.
- STEP 3 | Define the configuration Name and Description.
- STEP 4 | Select the <kbd>Log Type</kbd> to forward:
  - Alerts — Send notifications for specific alert types (for example, XDR Agent or BIOC).
  - Agent Audit Logs — Send notifications for audit logs reported by Cortex XDR agents.
  - Management Audit Logs — Send notifications for audit logs about events related to Cortex XDR management console.
- STEP 5 | In the <kbd>Configuration Scope<kbd>
  - Filter the type of information want included in a notification.
  - For example
  - `filter Severity = Medium`,
  - `Alert Source = XDR Agent`.
  - Cortex XDR sends the alerts or events matching this filter as a notification.
- STEP 6 | Define <kbd>Email Configuration</kbd>.
  1. In Email Distribution, add the email addresses to which want to send email notifications.
  2. Define the Email Grouping Time Frame, in minutes, to specify how often Cortex XDR sends notifications.
     1. Every 30 alerts or 30 events aggregated within this time frame are sent together in one notification, sorted according to the severity.
     2. To send a notification when one alert or event is generated, set the time frame to 0.
  3. Choose whether want Cortex XDR to provide an auto-generated subject.
  4. If previously used the Log Forwarding app and want to continue forwarding logs in the same format, Use Legacy Log Format. See Cortex XDR Log Notification Formats.


- STEP 7 | Configure additional forwarding options:
  - Depending on the notification integrations supported by the Log Type, configure the desired notification settings.
    - Slack notification — Select a Slack channel.
      - Before select a Slack channel, must Integrate Slack for Outbound Notifications.
    - Syslog receiver—Select a Syslog receiver.
      - Before select a Syslog server, must Integrate a Syslog Receiver in Cortex XDR app.


- STEP 8 | (Optional) To later modify a saved forwarding configuration, right-click the configuration, and Edit, Disable, or Delete it.

### Cortex XDR Log Notification Formats

When Cortex XDR alerts and audit logs are forwarded to an external data source, notifications are sent in the following formats.
- `Alert` Notification Format
- `Agent Audit Log` Notification Format
- `Management Audit Log` Notification Format
- Legacy—Cortex XDR Log Format for IOC and BIOC Alerts
- Legacy—Cortex XDR (formerly Traps) Log Formats

> If prefer Cortex XDR to forward logs in <kbd>legacy format</kbd>, choose the legacy option in log forwarding configuration.

---

#### Alert Notification Format
Cortex XDR Agent, BIOC, IOC, Analytics and third-party alerts are forwarded to external data resources according to the following formats.

Email Account
- Alert notifications are sent to email accounts according to the settings configured when Configure Notification Forwarding.
- If only one alert exists in the queue, a single alert email format is sent.
- If more than one alert was grouped in the time frame, all the alerts in the queue are forwarded together in a grouped email format.
- Emails also include an alert code snippet of the fields of the alerts according to the columns in the Alert table.

#### Cortex XDR Analytics Log Format
- Cortex XDR Analytics logs its alerts to the Cortex Data Lake as analytics alert logs. If you configure Cortex XDR to forward logs in legacy format, each log record has the following format:


Syslog format:
> sub_type,time_generated,id,version_info/document_version,version_info/ magnifier_version,version_info/detection_version,alert/url,alert/ category,alert/type,alert/name,alert/description/html,alert/description/ text,alert/severity,alert/state,alert/is_whitelisted,alert/ports,alert/ internal_destinations/single_destinations,alert/internal_destinations/ ip_ranges,alert/external_destinations,alert/app_id,alert/schedule/ activity_first_seen_at,alert/schedule/activity_last_seen_at,alert/schedule/ first_detected_at,alert/schedule/last_detected_at,user/user_name,user/ url,user/display_name,user/org_unit,device/id,device/url,device/mac,device/ hostname,device/ip,device/ip_ranges,device/owner,device/org_unit,files

Email body format example:
- When analytics alert logs are forwarded by email, each field is labeled, one line per field:

> sub_type: Update
time_generated: 1547717480
id: 4
version_info/document_version: 1 version_info/magnifier_version: 1.8

#### Cortex XDR Log Formats

The following topics list the fields of each Cortex XDR log type that the <kbd>Cortex Data Lake app</kbd> can forward to an external server or email destination.
- With log forwarding to a syslog receiver, the <kbd>Cortex Data Lake</kbd> sends logs in the `IETF syslog message format defined in RFC 5425`.
- To facilitate parsing, the delimiter is a comma and each field is a comma-separated value (CSV) string.
- The FUTURE_USE tag applies to fields that Cortex XDR does not currently implement.

With log forwarding to an email destination, the Cortex Data Lake sends an email with each field on a separate line in the email body.
- Threat Logs
- Config Logs
- Analytics Logs
- System Logs


**Threat Logs**
- Syslog format: recordType, class, FUTURE_USE, eventType, generatedTime, serverTime, agentTime, tzOffset, FUTURE_USE, facility, customerId, trapsId, serverHost, serverComponentVersion, regionId, isEndpoint, agentId, osType, isVdi, osVersion, is64, agentIp, deviceName, deviceDomain, severity, trapsSeverity, agentVersion, contentVersion, protectionStatus, preventionKey, moduleId, profile, moduleStatusId, verdict, preventionMode, terminate, terminateTarget, quarantine, block, postDetected, eventParameters(Array), sourceProcessIdx(Array), targetProcessIdx(Array), fileIdx(Array), processes(Array), files(Array), users(Array), urls(Array), description(Array)

 About Managed Security
Cortex XDR supports pairing multiple Cortex XDR environments with a single interface enabling Managed Security Services Providers (MSSP) and Managed Detection and Response (MDR) providers to easily manage security on behalf of their clients.
Pairing an MSSP/MDR (parent) tenant with a client (child) tenant requires a separate Cortex XDR license for the parent tenant. To ensure tenant access is acceptable to the parent and child, alike, both need to approve the pairing from within the Cortex XDR app.


 Cortex XDR Managed Security Access Requirements
To set up a managed security pairing, and child tenants must activate the Cortex XDR app, provide role permission, and define access configurations.
The following table describes what and where and child tenants need to define:
  Tenant
    Application
    Action
   Child
     Customer Support Portal (CSP) Account
   Add the user name from the parent tenant who is initiating the parent-child pairing.
      Hub
 Provide the user name added in CSP with Admin role permissions to access the child Cortex XDR instance.
     Parent
     Hub
    Ensure the user name added to the child tenant’s CSP account has Admin role permissions on the parent Cortex XDR instance.


 Set up Managed Threat Hunting
Cortex XDR provides the Managed Threat Hunting service as an add-on security service. To use Cortex XDR Managed Threat Hunting, must purchase a Managed Threat Hunting license and have a Cortex XDR Pro for Endpoint license with a minimum of 500 endpoints.
Managed Threat Hunting augments security by providing 24/7, year-round monitoring by Palo
Alto Networks threat researchers and Unit 42 experts. The Managed Threat Hunting teams proactively safeguard organization and provide threat reports for critical security incidents and impact reports for emerging threats that provide an analysis of exposure in organization. In addition, the Managed Threat Hunting team can identify incidents and provide in-depth review of related threat reports.
To get started with Managed Threat Hunting:
- STEP 1 | Access the Cortex XDR app and approve the pairing request sent to Cortex XDR tenant.
To approve the pairing, navigate to , locate the Request for Pairing notification, and select Approve. After the request is approved, Cortex XDR displays the Managed Threat Hunting label at the top of the
screen.
- STEP 2 | Configure notification emails for the impact reports and threat inquiries want Cortex XDR to send.
1. Select > Settings > Managed Threat Hunting.
2. Enter one or more email addresses to which want to send reports and inquires and ADD each
one.
3. Save changes.
- STEP 3 | (Optional) If desired, forward Managed Threat Hunting alerts to external sources such as email or slack from the > Settings > Notifications page.
This will forward both the alert itself and the detailed report in a PDF format.


 Pair a Parent Tenant with Child Tenant
After and child tenants have acquired the appropriate role permissions, pair tenant to child tenants.
Pairing a Parent and Child Tenant
- STEP 1 | From Cortex XDR app, select   > Settings > Tenant Management. The Tenant Management table displays the:
- Tenant Name—Name of the child tenant
- Pairing Status—State of a pairing request; Paired, Pending, Failed, Rejected
- Account Name—CSP account to which the child tenant is associated with
- Last Sync—Timestamp of when parent tenant last made contact with child tenant
- Managed Security Actions - a column for each security action with a status; configuration name or
Unmanaged. Unmanaged status means that a configuration for the security action has not yet been selected.
- STEP 2 | + Pair Tenant.
- STEP 3 | In the Pair Tenant window, select the child tenant want to pair. The drop-down only
displays child tenants are allowed to pair with.
Child tenants are grouped according to:
- Unpaired—Children that have not yet been paired and are available. If another parent has requested to pair with the child but the child has not yet agreed, the tenant will appear.
- Paired—Children that have already been paired to this parent.
- Paired with others—Children that have been paired with other parents.
- Pending—Children with a pending pairing request.
- STEP 4 | Pair the tenant.
Cortex XDR sends a Request for Pairing to the specified child tenant.
- STEP 5 | In the child tenant Cortex XDR console, a child tenant user with Admin role permissions needs to approve the pairing by navigating to , locate the Request for Pairing notification and
select Approve.
- STEP 6 | Verify the parent-child pairing.
After pairing has been approved, in the child tenant’s Cortex XDR app, when navigating to a page managed by a parent configuration, the child user is notified by a flag who is managing their security:
In the child tenant’s, pages managed by appear with a read-only banner. Child tenant users cannot perform any actions from these pages, but can view the configurations create on their behalf.

  Unpairing a Parent and Child Tenant
When want to discontinue the pairing with a child tenant, in the Tenant Management page, right- click the tenant row and select Request Unpairing. For the unpairing to take effect, the child tenant must approve the request.
When a child wants to unpair, the child user needs to navigate to and select Unpair.


 Manage a Child Tenant
Pairing a child tenant allows to view and investigate the child tenant Cortex XDR data, and initiate security actions on their behalf.
In Cortex XDR, have access to view the following pages:
- Incidents
- Alerts
- Query Builder
- Query Center and Results
- Causality View
- Timeline View
To initiate security actions on child tenant, need to create a Configuration. Security actions are managed by configurations create in the Cortex XDR app and then assign to each of the child tenants. Each action requires it’s own configuration and allocation to a child tenant. create configuration for the following actions:
- BIOC Rules
- Exclusions
- Starred Alerts
- Profiles
The following sections describe how to manage child tenants.
- Track Tenant Management
- View Child Tenant Data
- Create and Allocate Action Configurations
- Initiate a Security Managed Action
Track Tenant Management
After successfully pairing child tenant, navigate to child tenant details.
> Settings > Tenant Management to view the
  The Tenant Management page displays the following information about each of child tenants:
  Field
    Description
  Status Indicator (   )
Identifies whether the child tenant is connected.
