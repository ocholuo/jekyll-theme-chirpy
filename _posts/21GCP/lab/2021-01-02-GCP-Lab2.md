* Perform other commands in Cloud Shell


Task 0. Lab Setup
-----------------

Task 1. Explore the Google Cloud Console
----------------------------------------

---


### Cloud Storage: create a bucket

> Cloud Storage buckets must have a globally unique name.
> easily get a unique name for our bucket by using the ID of the Google Cloud project that Qwiklabs created for us, because Google Cloud project IDs are also globally unique.

1. Google Cloud Console > **Storage** > **Browser**.
2. Click **Create bucket**.
   1. For **Name**, paste in the Google Cloud project ID string you copied in an earlier step.
   2. Leave all other values as their defaults.
3. Click **Create**.
   - ![Screen Shot 2021-02-11 at 13.52.24](https://i.imgur.com/9IBkRsg.png)

> The Google Cloud Console has a **Notifications** (![notifications icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/F5kQGlErW%2BjJRPG8ZwXMUKHhAaugHazVETpa1WSg8aM%3D)) icon. Feedback from the underlying commands is sometimes provided there. You can click the icon to check the notifications for additional information and history.

---


### Create a virtual machine (VM) instance

1. click **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
2. Click **Create Instance**.
   1. For **Name**: `first-vm` 
   2. For **Region**: `us-central1`.
   3. For **Zone**: `us-central1-c`.
   4. For **Machine type**, examine the options.
      - The **Machine type:** menu lists the number of virtual CPUs, the amount of memory, and a symbolic name such as _e1-standard-1_.
      - The symbolic name is the parameter you use to select the machine type when using the `gcloud` command to create a VM.
      - To the right of the region, zone, and machine type is a per-month estimated cost.
      - To see the breakdown of estimated costs, click **Details** to the right of the **Machine type** list underneath the estimated costs.
      1. For **Machine type**, click **2 vCPUs (e2-standard-2)**
      2. For **Machine type,** click **e2-micro (2 shared vCPU)**.
      - The micro type is a shared-core VM that is inexpensive.
   5. For **Firewall**, click **Allow HTTP traffic**.
3. Leave the remaining settings as their defaults, and click **Create**.

---


### Explore the VM details

1. **VM instances** page, click `first-vm`.
2. Locate **CPU platform**, click **Edit**.
   - can't change the machine type, the CPU platform, or the zone of a running Google Cloud VM.
   - can add network tags and allow specific network traffic from the internet through firewalls.
   - can add disks, determine whether the boot disk is deleted when the instance is deleted.
3. Scroll down and examine  
4. Click **Cancel**.

--- 


### Create an IAM service account

1. **IAM & admin** > **Service accounts**.

2. Click **+ Create service account**.
3. **Service account details** page,
   1. **Service account name**: `test-service-account`.
   2. Click **Create**.
4. **Service account permissions** page
   1. role as **Project** > **Editor**.
   2. Click **Continue**.
5. Click **Done**.

6. **Service accounts** > `test-service-account` > click three dots `Action`.
   1. Click **Create Key**.
   2. Select **JSON** as the key type.
   3. Click **Create**.
   4. Click **Close**.

---


Task 2. Explore Cloud Shell
---------------------------
 

---

### Open Cloud Shell and explore its features

1. click **Activate Cloud Shell** > click **Continue**.

   * **Hide/Restore:** This icon hides and restores the window, giving you full access to the Google Cloud Console without closing Cloud Shell.

   * **Open in new window:** Having Cloud Shell at the bottom of the Google Cloud Console is useful when you are issuing individual commands. But when you edit files or want to see the full output of a command, clicking this icon displays Cloud Shell in a full-sized terminal window.

   * **Close all tabs:** This icon closes Cloud Shell. Everytime you close Cloud Shell, the virtual machine is recycled and all machine context is lost. However, data that you stored in your home directory is still available to you the next time you start Cloud Shell.

---


### Use Cloud Shell to set up the environment variables

> use the following commands to define the environment variables used in this task.

1. Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the first bucket from task 1.
2. Replace [BUCKET_NAME_2] with a globally unique name.

```bash
MY_BUCKET_NAME_1=qwiklabs-gcp-03-529929a89c8f
MY_BUCKET_NAME_2=qwiklabs-gcp-03-529929a89c8f_2
MY_REGION=us-central1
```

---


### Move the credentials file into Cloud Shell

> You downloaded a JSON-encoded credentials file in an earlier task when you created your first Cloud IAM service account.

1. On your local workstation
   - locate the JSON key
   - rename the file to `credentials.json`.

2. In Cloud Shell, click the three dots (![Three-dot menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/5OEwfJEfsSg8zDSsYjmqhsK7fRiAcDrW50FJ0Axw%2Fk8%3D)) icon 

3. Click **Upload file**
   - upload the `credentials.json` file to the Cloud Shell VM.

4. In Cloud Shell, type **ls** to confirm that the file was uploaded.


---


### Create a second Cloud Storage bucket

1. In Cloud Shell
   - use the `gsutil` command to create a bucket.
   - `gsutil mb gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_2`

2. Google Cloud Console > **Storage** > **Browser** > click **Refresh** if you are already in the Storage Browser.
   - The second bucket should appear in the **Buckets** list.


---


### Use the gcloud command line to create a second virtual machine

1. create the VM

```bash
# 1. to list all the zones in a given region:
gcloud compute zones list | grep $MY_REGION


# 2. Select a zone from the first column of the list. 

# 3. store your chosen zone in an environment variable.
MY_ZONE=us-central1-c

# 4. Set this zone to be your default zone by executing the following command.
gcloud config set compute/zone $MY_ZONE


# 5. store a name in an environment variable you will use to create a VM.
MY_VMNAME=second-vm


# 6. Create a VM in the default zone that you set earlier in this task using the new environment variable to assign the VM name.
gcloud compute instances create $MY_VMNAME \
  --machine-type "e2-standard-2" \
  --image-project "debian-cloud" \
  --image-family "debian-9" \
  --subnet "default"


# 7. List the virtual machine instances in your project.
gcloud compute instances list
# both your newly created and your first virtual machine in the list.
# NAME       ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP    STATUS
# first-vm   us-central1-c  e2-micro                    10.128.0.2   35.239.43.203  RUNNING
# second-vm  us-central1-c  e2-standard-2               10.128.0.3   35.226.88.66   RUNNING
```

1. Google Cloud Console > **Navigation menu** , click **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
   - see both of the virtual machines created.

2. Look at the `External IP` column.
   - the external IP address of the first VM you created is shown as a link. (If necessary, click the `HIDE INFO PANEL` button to reveal the `External IP` column.)
   - The Google Cloud Console offers the link because you configured this VM's firewall to allow HTTP traffic.

3. Click the link you found in your VM's `External IP` column.
   - Your browser will present a `Connection refused` message in a new browser tab.
   - This message occurs because, although there is a firewall port open for HTTP traffic to your VM, no Web server is running there.
   - Close the browser tab you just created.


---


### create a second service account

1. In Cloud Shell

```bash
# create a new service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create test-service-account2 \
   --display-name "test-service-account2"


# If you see the following output, type **y** and press **ENTER**:
# API [iam.googleapis.com] not enabled on project [560255523887]. Would you like to enable and retry (this will take a few minutes)? (y/N)?
```


2. Google Cloud Console > **IAM & admin** > **Service accounts**.
   - Refresh the page till you see **test-service-account2**.


```bash
# to grant the second service account the Project viewer role:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
   --member serviceAccount:test-service-account2@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
   --role roles/viewer

# `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` is an environment variable that is automatically populated in Cloud Shell and is set to the project ID of the current context. 
```

4. Google Cloud Console > **IAM & admin** > **IAM**.
   - Select the new service account called **test-service-account2**.

5. right hand side of the page, click on pencil icon and expand the Viewer role.
   - see **test-service-account2** listed as a member of the Viewer role.




Task 3. Work with Cloud Storage in Cloud Shell
----------------------------------------------


### Download a file to Cloud Shell and copy it to Cloud Storage

```bash
# 1. Copy a picture of a cat from a Google-provided Cloud Storage bucket to your Cloud Shell.
gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/ak8s/cat.jpg cat.jpg


# 2. Copy the file into one of the buckets that you created earlier.
gsutil cp cat.jpg gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_1


# 3. Copy the file from the first bucket into the second bucket:
gsutil cp gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_1/cat.jpg gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_2/cat.jpg
```

1. Google Cloud Console > **Storage** > **Browser**
   - select the buckets that you created, and verify that both contain the `cat.jpg` file.


---


### Set the access control list for a Cloud Storage object

```bash
# 1. To get the default access list that's been assigned to `cat.jpg`
gsutil acl get gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_1/cat.jpg  > acl.txt
cat acl.txt
# output shows that anyone with a Project Owner, Editor, or Viewer role for the project has access (Owner access for Owners/Editors and Reader access for Viewers).
#   [
#   {
#     "entity": "project-owners-560255523887",
#     "projectTeam": {
#     "projectNumber": "560255523887",
#     "team": "owners"
#     },
#   gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/ak8s/cat.jpg cat.jpg  "role": "OWNER"
#   },
#   {
#     "entity": "project-editors-560255523887",
#     "projectTeam": {
#     "projectNumber": "560255523887",
#     "team": "editors"
#     },
#     "role": "OWNER"
#   },
#   {
#     "entity": "project-viewers-560255523887",
#     "projectTeam": {
#     "projectNumber": "560255523887",
#     "team": "viewers"
#     },
#     "role": "READER"
#   },
#   {
#     "email": "google12345678_student@qwiklabs.net",
#     "entity": "user-google12345678_student@qwiklabs.net",
#     "role": "OWNER"
#   }
#   ]


# 2. To change the object to have private access, execute the following command:
gsutil acl set private gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_1/cat.jpg


# 3. To verify the new ACL that's been assigned to `cat.jpg`, execute the following two commands:
gsutil acl get gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_1/cat.jpg  > acl-2.txt
cat acl-2.txt


# The output should look similar to the following example. Now only the original creator of the object (your lab account) has Owner access.
  [
  {
    "email": "google12345678_student@qwiklabs.net",
    "entity": "user-google12345678_student@qwiklabs.net",
    "role": "OWNER"
  }
  ]
```

### Authenticate as a service account in Cloud Shell


1. In Cloud Shell


```bash
# 1. execute the following command to view the current configuration:
gcloud config list
# output 
#   [component_manager]
#   disable_update_check = True
#   [compute]
#   gce_metadata_read_timeout_sec = 5
#   zone = us-central1-a
#   [core]
#   account = google12345678_student@qwiklabs.net
#   disable_usage_reporting = False
#   project = qwiklabs-Google Cloud-1aeffbc5d0acb416
#   [metrics]
#   environment = devshell
#   Your active configuration is: [cloudshell-16441]


# 2. change the authenticated user to the first service account through the credentials uploaded into Cloud Shell (`credentials.json`).
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file credentials.json
# Cloud Shell is now authenticated as `test-service-account`.


# 3. To verify the active account, execute the following command:
gcloud config list
# output
# The account is now set to the `test-service-account` service account.
#   [component_manager]
#   disable_update_check = True
#   [compute]
#   gce_metadata_read_timeout_sec = 5
#   zone = us-central1-a
#   [core]
#   account = test-service-account@qwiklabs-Google Cloud-1aeffbc5d0acb416.iam.gserviceaccount.com
#   disable_usage_reporting = False
#   project = qwiklabs-Google Cloud-1aeffbc5d0acb416
#   [metrics]
#   environment = devshell
#   Your active configuration is: [cloudshell-16441]


# 4. To verify the list of authorized accounts in Cloud Shell, execute the following command:
gcloud auth list
# **Output**
#                               Credentialed Accounts
# ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
#         student-03-8f6a8a61dece@qwiklabs.net
# *       test-service-account@qwiklabs-gcp-03-529929a89c8f.iam.gserviceaccount.com
# To set the active account, run:
#     $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`


# 5. To verify that the current account (`test-service-account`) cannot access the `cat.jpg` file in the first bucket 
gsutil cp gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_1/cat.jpg ./cat-copy.jpg
# Because you restricted access to this file to the owner earlier in this task you should see output that looks like the following example.
# **Output**
#   Copying gs://test-bucket-123/cat.jpg...
#   AccessDeniedException: 403  KiB]


# 6. Verify that the current account (`test-service-account`) can access the `cat.jpg` file in the second bucket that you created:
gsutil cp gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_2/cat.jpg ./cat-copy.jpg
# **Output**
#   Copying gs://test-bucket-123/cat.jpg...
#   - [1 files][ 81.7 KiB/ 81.7 KiB]
#   Operation completed over 1 objects/81.7 KiB.


# 7. To switch to the lab account, execute the following command.
# replace `[USERNAME]` with the username provided in the Qwiklabs Connection Details pane left of the lab instructions page. .
gcloud config set account student-03-8f6a8a61dece@qwiklabs.net


# 8. To verify that you can access the `cat.jpg` file in the [BUCKET_NAME] bucket (the first bucket that you created), execute the following command.
gsutil cp gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_1/cat.jpg ./copy2-of-cat.jpg
# The lab account created the bucket and object and remained an Owner when the object access control list (ACL) was converted to private, so the lab account can still access the object.
# **Output**
#   Copying gs://test-bucket-123/cat.jpg...
#   - [1 files][ 81.7 KiB/ 81.7 KiB]
#   Operation completed over 1 objects/81.7 KiB.


# 9. Make the first Cloud Storage bucket readable by everyone, including unauthenticated users.
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://$MY_BUCKET_NAME_1
# This is an appropriate setting for hosting public website content in Cloud Storage.
```


10. Google Cloud Console > **Storage** > **Browser**,
    - select the first storage bucket that you created. Notice that the `cat.jpg` file has a `Public link`. Copy this link.

11. Open an incognito browser tab and paste the link into its address bar.
