# GCP Google Cloud Platform

---

GCP offers four main kinds of services:
- compute, storage, big data and machine learning.

---

## GCP regions and zones

> global > multi region > region > zone

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 14.52.03](https://i.imgur.com/mIV2CbL.png)


Deploying applications across multiple zones
- enables fault tolerance and high availability
- network latencies generally less than 1 millisecond
  - zone and region

The network interconnects with the public Internet and more than 90 Internet exchanges and more than 100 points of presence worldwide.

edge network location
- When an Internet user sends traffic to a Google resource,
- Google responds to the user's request from an edge network location that will provide the lowest latency or delay.
- Google's edge casting network places the content close to users to minimize that latency

## GCP Resource

> Zones and regions physically organize the GCP resources
> Projects logically organize the GCP resources

### project
- the base level organizing entity for
  - creating and using resources and services, and managing billing APIs, and permissions.

- The GCP resources must belong to a project.  

- Projects can be easily created, managed, deleted, or even recovered from accidental deletions.  

- labels are changeable, project ID and project number remain fixed.
  - unique project ID and project number.
  - can name the project and apply labels for filtering.

### folder
- Projects can belong to a folder, which is another grouping mechanism.
- use folders to reflect their hierarchy of the enterprise and apply policies at the right levels within the enterprise.
- can nest folders inside of folder
- ![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 15.09.24](https://i.imgur.com/pHBr2vk.png)


organization
- organization owns all the folders beneath it.
- the root node of a GCP resource hierarchy.
- having organization is required for you to use folders.
- G Suite customer already it

### The Google Cloud Platform resource hierarchy

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 15.11.03](https://i.imgur.com/ucg52Zc.png)

The GCP resource hierarchy
- helps you manage resources across multiple departments and multiple teams within the organization.
- define a hierarchy to create trust boundaries in resource isolation

## interact with Google Cloud

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 15.29.56](https://i.imgur.com/VPu8vIk.png)

4 ways to interact with Google Cloud
- Google Cloud Console
  - web user interface
  - ![Screen Shot 2021-02-10 at 22.01.19](https://i.imgur.com/hONolff.png)
- Cloud SDK and Cloud Shell
  - command-line interface
    * `gcloud`: Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and many Google Cloud services
    * `gsutil`: Cloud Storage
    * `kubectl`: GKE and Kubernetes
    * `bq`: BigQuery
  - Cloud Shell
    - command-line access to cloud resources directly from browser.
      - Web preview functionality
    - Cloud SDK command-line tools always available, up to date, and fully authenticated.
      * Preinstalled Cloud SDK and other tools
    - ephemeral compute engine virtual machine instance
    - build-in authorization for access to Cloud Console project and resource
    - Temporary Compute Engine VM
      - 5 GB of persistent disk storage (`$HOME dir`)
    - Language support for Java, Go, Python, Node.js, PHP, and Ruby  
  - After 1 hour of inactivity, the Cloud Shell instance is recycled.
    - Only the `/home` directory persists.
    - Any changes made to the system configuration, including environment variables, are lost between sessions.

- Cloud Console mobile app
  - For iOS and Android
- REST-based API
  - for custom application


> creating environment variables is a good practice. You can easily and consistently re-use these environment variables, which makes your work less error-prone.

## VPC Virtual Private Cloud

### Virtual Private Cloud

- define the own VPC inside the GCP project, or choose the default VPC and get started with that.

- VPC networks connect the Google Cloud platform resources to each other and to the internet.
  - segment the networks,
  - use firewall rules to restrict access to instances,
  - and create static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations.

- <font color=red> Networks are global; subnets are regional </font>
  - The Virtual Private Cloud networks have global scope.
  - can have subnets in any GCP region worldwide
  - subnets can span the zones that make up a region.

- benifit:
  - define the own network layout with global scope.
  - can have resources in different zones on the same subnet.
  - can dynamically increase the size of a subnet in a custom network by expanding the range of IP addresses allocated to it.
  - Doing that doesn't affect already configured VMs.

- VPC subnets have regional scope.
  - subnet can span the zones that make up a region.
  - solutions can incorporate fault tolerance without complicating the network topology.

example
- the VPC has one network.
- it has one subnet defined in GCP us-east1 region.
- it has two Compute Engine VMs attached to it.
- They're neighbors on the same subnet even though they are in different zones.
- solutions that are resilient but still have simple network layouts.

---

### routing tables
- Much like physical networks, VPCs have routing tables.
- used to forward traffic from one instance to another instance within the same network.
- Even across sub-networks and even between GCP zones without requiring an external IP address.
- VPCs routing tables are built in,
  - don't have to provision or manage a router.
  - don't have to provision or manage for GCP, a firewall instance.

---

### global distributed firewall.
- control to restrict access to instances, both incoming and outgoing traffic.
- define firewall rules in terms of metadata tags on Compute Engine instances
- example
- tag all the web servers with say, "web,"
- and write a firewall rule saying that traffic on ports 80 or 443 is allowed into all VMs with the "web" tag, no matter what their IP address happens to be.


---

### VPC connection

> VPCs belong to GCP projects
> if the company has several GCP projects and the VPCs need to talk to each other

VPC Peering
- peering relationship between two VPCs to exchange traffic  
- to interconnect networks in GCP projects

Shared VPC
- to share a network, or individual subnets, with other GCP projects
- to use the full power of IAM
- to control who and what in one project can interact with a VPC in another


---


### Cloud Load Balancing

- a fully distributed, software-defined managed service for all the traffic.
- because the load balancers don't run in VMs, no worry about scaling or managing them.
- put Cloud Load Balancing in front of all the traffic
  - HTTP and HTTPS, TCP and SSL traffic, and UDP traffic too.

- Cloud Load Balancing
  - basic
    - you application presents a single front-end to the world
    - users get a single, global anycast IP address
    - Traffic goes over the google backbone from the closet point-of-presence to the user
      - backend instances in regions around the world.
  - provides <font color=red> cross-region load balancing </font>
    - including automatic multi-region failover,
  - backbone are selected based on load
    - Cloud Load Balancing reacts quickly to changes in users, traffic, backend health, network conditions, and other related conditions.  
    - gently moves traffic in fractions if backends become unhealthy.
    - only healthy backends receive reaffic
    - no pre-warming is required

different load balancer
1. <font color=red> global HTTPS load balancer </font>
   - layer 7 load balancing based on load
   - cross regional load balancing for a web application
   - route different URLs to different back ends

2. <font color=red> global SSL proxy load balancer </font>
   - layer 4 load balancing of non-HTTPS SSL traffic based on load
   - For Secure Sockets Layer traffic that is not HTTP
   - Supported on specific port numbers
   - only work for TCP and specific port numbers

3. <font color=red> global TCP proxy load balancer </font>
   - layer 4 load balancing of non-SSL TCP traffic
   - If it's other TCP traffic that does not use Secure Sockets Layer
   - Supported on specific port numbers
   - only work for TCP and specific port numbers

4. <font color=red> regional load balancer </font>
   - load balancing of any traffic (TCP/UDP) on any port number
   - load balance across a GCP region with the regional load balancer

5. <font color=red> internal load balancer </font>
   - load balance traffic inside a VPC / the project
   - for traffic
     - coming into the Google network from the internet.
       - example:
       - between the presentation layer and the business logic layer of the application
     - TCP traffic on arbitrary port numbers
     - UDP traffic
   - accepts traffic on a GCP internal IP address and load balances it across Compute Engine VMs.
   - for the interbal tiers of multi-tier applications
   - to load-balance traffic among the back-end VMs that form part of a multi-tier application.

### DNS
- 8.8.8.8
  - Google services
  - provides a public domain name service to the world.
    - DNS is what translates internet host names to addresses.
  - Google has a highly developed DNS infrastructure.
    - It makes 8.8.8.8 available so that everybody can take advantage of it.  
- Cloud DNS
  - for the internet host names and addresses of applications build in GCP
  - to help the world find them
  - a managed DNS service running on the same infrastructure as Google.
  - It has low latency and high availability
  - a cost-effective way to make the applications and services available to the users.
  - The DNS information you publish is served from redundant locations around the world.
  - Cloud DNS is also programmable.
    - publish and manage millions of DNS zones and records
    - using the GCP console, the command line interface or the API.

---


### Google Cloud CDN
- Google has a global system of edge caches.
- You can use this system to accelerate content delivery in the application
- the customers
  - experience lower network latency.
- The origins of the content
  - experience reduced load
  - and save money too.
- Once you've set up HTTPS load balancing, simply enable Cloud CDN with a single checkbox.
- CDN is a part of GCPs,
  - CDN interconnect partner program and you can continue to use it.

---

### connection

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 20.38.04](https://i.imgur.com/pcVgd0Y.png)
- interconnect their networks to Google VPCs
  - such as on-premises networks or their networks in other clouds.  

- Virtual Private Network
  - Virtual Private Network connection over the internet using the IPSEC protocol.
  - Cloud Router
    - simple way to let a VPN into Google VPC continue to work in spite of routing changes,
    - Cloud Router lets their networks and the Google VPC exchange route information over the VPN using the Border Gateway Protocol.
    - example
      - add a new subnet to the Google VPC,
      - the on-premises network will automatically get routes to it.

- Direct Peering
  - don't want to use the internet
    - either because of security concerns or need more reliable bandwidth.
  - peering with Google using Direct Peering.
  - putting a router in the same public data center as a <font color=red> Google point of presence </font> and exchanging traffic.
  - Google has more than 100 <font color=red> points of presence </font> around the world.
  - Customers who aren't already in a point of presence can contract with a partner in the carrier peering program to get connected.
  - One downside:
    - it isn't covered by a Google service level agreement.
    - Customers who want the highest uptimes for their interconnection with Google should use Dedicated Interconnect
  - If these connections have topologies that meet Google's specifications, they can be covered by up to a 99.99 percent SLA.
  - These connections can be backed up by a VPN for even greater reliability.

- Dedicated Interconnect
  - customers get one or more direct private connections to Google.
  - highest uptimes for their interconnection with Google

## API

![Screen Shot 2021-02-09 at 00.38.36](https://i.imgur.com/Z0xoKOL.png)

Application Programming Interfaces, APIs
- A software services implementation can be complex and changeable.
- to use that service
  - instead other pieces of software had to know internal details about how they worked
  - application developers structure the software, so that it presents a clean, well-defined interface that abstracts away needless details and then they document that interface.
  - That's an API.
- The underlying implementation can change as long as the interface doesn't
  - and other pieces of software that use the API don't have to know or care.
  - to change an API (add or deprecate a feature)
    - version the APIs.
      - To make the API change cleanly
      - API v2 might contain calls that v1 does not.
    - Programs that consume the API can specify the API version that they want to use in their calls.

- Supporting API, Google Cloud platform provides two API management tools.
  - Cloud Endpoints
  - Apigee Edge

---


### Cloud Endpoints
- Suppose
  - you're developing a software service and one of GCP's backends.
  - to make it easy to expose this API.
  - an easy way to monitor and log its use.

- to create and maintain APIs
  - an easy to deploy proxy in front of the software service

- Distributed API management through an API console
  - provides an API console
  - implements those capabilities in an easy-to-manage interface.

- expose the API using a RESTful interface

- <font color=red> supports applications running in GCP's compute platforms </font> in the languages and the client technologies.
  - Runtime environment
    - App Engine Flexible environment
    - Kubernetes Engine
    - Compute Engine
  - Clients
    - Android
    - iOS
    - Javascript
- control access and validate calls with JSON Web Tokens and Google API keys
  - identify web, mobile users with Auth0 and Firebase Authentication
  - to make sure it's only consumed by other developers whom you trust.
  - for the API to have a single coherent way for it to know which end user is making the call.  
- generate client libraries


---

### Apigee Edge
- a platform
  - for developing and managing API proxies.
  - for making APIs available to the customers and partners
- It has a different orientation though.
- Contains analytics, monetization, and a developer portal
- focus on business problems
  - like rate limiting, quotas, and analytics.
- <font color=red> Many users of Apigee Edge are providing a software service to other companies </font> and those features come in handy.
  - do business analytics and billing on a customer-facing API
- Because of the backend services for Apigee Edge need not be in GCP
  - engineers often use it when they are "taking apart" a legacy application.
  - Instead of replacing a monolithic application in one risky move
    - they use Apigee Edge to peel off its services one by one,
    - standing up microservices to implement each in turn,
    - until the legacy application can be finally retired.
