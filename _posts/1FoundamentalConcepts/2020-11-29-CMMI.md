# CMM - Capability Maturity Model Integration

**Capability Maturity Model Integration** (**CMMI**)
- a process level improvement training and appraisal program.
- Administered by the **CMMI Institute**, Subsidiary of "ISACA"
- required by many U.S. Government contracts, especially in "Software development".
- CMMI can be used to `guide process improvement across a project, division, or an entire organization`.
- may also be used as a framework for appraising the process maturity of the organization.
- CMMI defines the following maturity levels for processes: `Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimizing`.

Originally CMMI addresses three areas of interest:
1. Product and service development – CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV),
2. Service establishment, management, – CMMI for Services (CMMI-SVC),
3. Product and service acquisition – CMMI for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ).

In version 2.0 these three areas (that previously had a separate model each) were merged into a single model.

### Representation

CMMI existed in two representations: continuous and staged.
- the `continuous representation` is designed to allow the user to
  - focus on the specific processes that are considered important for the organization's immediate business objectives,
  - or those to which the organization assigns a high degree of risks.
- The `staged representation` is designed to
  - provide a standard sequence of improvements,
  - can serve as a basis for comparing the maturity of different projects and organizations.
  - The staged representation also provides for an easy migration from the SW-CMM to CMMI.

CMM衍生出了一些改善模型，比如：
1. SW-CMM (Software CMM) 软件CMM
2. SE-CMM (System Engineering CMM) 系统工程CMM
3. SA-CMM (Software Acquisition CMM) 软件采购CMM
4. IPT-CMM (Integrated Product Team CMM) 集成产品群组CMM
5. P-CMM (People CMM)人力资源能力成熟度模型

### Maturity levels for services

The process areas below and their maturity levels are listed for the CMMI for services model:

**Maturity Level 21 – 初始级**
* 软件过程是无序的，有时甚至是混乱的，
* 对过程几乎没有定义，
* 成功取决于个人努力。
* 管理是反应式的。


**Maturity Level 2 – Managed**
* 建立了基本的项目管理过程来跟踪费用、进度和功能特性。
* 制定了必要的过程纪律，能重复早先类似应用项目取得的成功经验。
* CM – Configuration Management
* MA – Measurement and Analysis
* PPQA – Process and Quality Assurance
* REQM – Requirements Management
* SAM – Supplier Agreement Management
* SD – Service Delivery
* WMC – Work Monitoring and Control
* WP – Work Planning



**Maturity Level 3 – Defined**
* 已将软件管理和工程两方面的过程文档化、标准化，并综合成该组织的标准软件过程。
* 所有项目均使用经批准、剪裁的标准软件过程来开发和维护软件，
* 软件产品的生产在整个软件过程是可见的。
* CAM – Capacity and Availability Management
* DAR – Decision Analysis and Resolution
* IRP – Incident Resolution and Prevention
* IWM – Integrated Work Managements
* OPD – Organizational Process Definition
* OPF – Organizational Process Focus...
* OT – Organizational Training
* RSKM – Risk Management
* SCON – Service Continuity
* SSD – Service System Development
* SST – Service System Transition
* STSM – Strategic Service Management


**Maturity Level 4 – Quantitatively Managed**
* 分析对软件过程和产品质量的详细度量数据，对软件过程和产品都有定量的理解与控制。
* 管理有一个作出结论的客观依据，管理能够在定量的范围内预测性能。
* OPP – Organizational Process Performance
* QWM – Quantitative Work Management


**Maturity Level 5 – Optimizing**
* 过程的量化反馈和先进的新思想、新技术促使过程持续不断改进。
* CAR – Causal Analysis and Resolution.
* OPM – Organizational Performance Management.

### Security

To address user security concerns, two unofficial security guides are available.

* OPSD – Organizational Preparedness for Secure Development
* SMP – Secure Management in Projects
* SRTS – Security Requirements and Technical Solution
* SVV – Security Verification and Validation

While they do not affect maturity or capability levels, these process areas can be reported in appraisal results.
