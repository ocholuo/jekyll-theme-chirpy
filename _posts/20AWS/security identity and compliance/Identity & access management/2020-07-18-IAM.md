# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)        ￼


---


## basics

> 颗粒状的 Granular permissions

![Screen Shot 2020-06-08 at 11.57.27](https://i.imgur.com/ZW9dsDI.png)


- a tool that centrally manages access to `launching, configuring, managing, and terminating resources in the AWS account`.




- grant different permissions to different people for different resources. **who, which, how**

- feature of the AWS account, offered at no additional charge.


IAM has the following features to control access:

- **Shared access**
  - grant other people permission to administer and use resources in the AWS account
  - without having to share your password or access key.

- provides **颗粒状的 Granular permissions** over access to resources
  - grant `different permissions` to `different people` for `different resources`.
  - including the ability to `specify exactly which API calls the user is authorized to make to each service`.
  - for AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS software development kits (SDKs), every call to an AWS service is an API call.

- **Secure access** to AWS resources
  - Integrated with may AWS services.
  - manage access to AWS services and resources securely. 
  - Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on EC2.
  - create and manage AWS users and groups. 
    - should use groups to assign permissions to IAM users 
    - should avoid embedding access keys in application code.


- **Temporary security credentials**
  - IAM can assign temporary security credentials to provide users with temporary access to services/resources.
  - AWS access key ID, secret access key, and security token.



- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
  - Add two-factor authentication to the account and to individual users
  - extra security.
  - authentication device that generates random, six-digit, single-use authentication codes
  - authenticate using an MFA device in the following two ways:
    - `AWS Management Console`: user name, password and authentication code.
    - `AWS API`: restrictions are added to IAM policies and developers can request temporary security credentials and pass MFA parameters in their AWS STS API requests.
    - `AWS CLI`: obtaining temporary security credentials from STS (aws sts get-session-token).



- **Identity federation**
  - Identity Federation (including AD, Facebook etc.) can be configured 
  - allow users who already have passwords elsewhere (corporate network) to get temporary access to the AWS account.
  - allowing secure access to resources in an AWS account `without creating an IAM user account`.
  - cannot use IAM to create local user accounts on any system.	

- **Eventually consistent**

- IAM is `not used for application-level authentication`.
- IAM is `universal (global)` and does not apply to regions.



- Identity information for assurance.


- PCI DSS compliance.


- work with AWS IAM in any of the following ways:
  - AWS Management Console.
  - AWS Command Line Tools.
  - AWS SDKs.
    - recommend use AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM.
  - IAM HTTPS API.
  - can also use IAM Query API to make direct calls to the IAM web service.
  - sign-in URL: 
    - `https://My_AWS_Account_ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/`
    - `https://console.aws.amazon.com/.`




- IAM can be used to manage:
  - Users. Groups. Access policies. Roles.
  - User credentials. User password policies.
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - API keys for programmatic access (CLI).


## essential components

- `IAM user`:
  - a `person/application` that is defined in an AWS account, and that must make API calls to AWS products.
  - Each user must have a unique name (no spaces in name) within the AWS account,
  - and a set of security credentials that are different from the AWS account root user security credentials.
  - Each user is defined in one and only one AWS account.
- `IAM group`:
  - a collection of users.
  - use groups to `simplify specifying and managing permissions for multiple users`.
- `IAM policy`:
  - a document that defines permissions to determine what users can do in the AWS account.
  - A policy typically `grants access to specific resources to user, or explicitly deny access`.
- `IAM role`:
  - a tool for granting temporary access to specific AWS resources in an AWS account.
  - only selected users or applications.
  - Aws service can access other service.


Use `IAM Policies` to control access to the following:
- `AWS for Principals`
  - Control what the person making the request (theprincipal) is allowed to do.
- `IAM Identities`
  - Control which `IAM identities (groups, users, and roles)` can be accessed and how.
- `IAM Policies`
  - Control who can create, edit, and delete customer managed policies,
  - and who can attach and detach all managed policies.
- `AWS Resources`
  - Control who has access to resources
  - using an `identity-based policy` or a `resource-based policy`.
- `AWS Accounts`
  - Control whether a request is allowed only for members of a specific account.

## The IAM console 
- provides information about when IAM users and roles last attempted to access AWS services. This information is called `service last accessed data`. 
  - help you identify unnecessary permissions 
  - to refine your IAM policies 
  - to better adhere to the principle of “least privilege.”
  - granting the minimum permissions required to perform a specific task. 
- You can find the data on the Access Advisor tab in the IAM console by examining the detail view for any IAM user, group, role, or managed policy.


---


## IAM BEST PRACTICES
- Lock away the AWS root user access keys. 
  - no access key for the root account user.
- not use the root account for anything other than billing.
  - Power user access allows all permissions except the management of groups and users in IAM.

- Create `individual IAM users`.
- Use AWS defined `policies` to assign permissions whenever possible.
- Use `groups` to assign permissions to IAM users.
- Grant least privilege.
- Use access levels to review IAM permissions.
- Use `roles` for applications that run on AWS EC2 instances.
- Delegate by using roles instead of sharing credentials.
- Configure a strong password policy for users.
- Enable MFA for all users.
- Rotate credentials regularly.
- Remove unnecessary credentials.
- Use policy conditions for extra security.
- Monitor activity in your AWS account.
- Use Temporary Security Credentials (IAM Roles) Instead of Long-Term Access Keys.
- Manage IAM User Access Keys Properly.

## IAM policy

- By default
- `the AWS account root user has full access`.
- `AWS account users do not have any permissions to any resources/data in AWS account`.
  - default AWS account has no access to any services:
  - must explicitly grant permissions to a user/group/role by `creating a policy`
  - attaching an IAM access policy to IAM user/group 

- All permissions are denied by default.
  - The most restrictive policy is applied.
  - The default `implicit deny` of an IAM identity can `be overridden` with an `explicit allow.`


- a document in `JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)` format
  - lists permissions that `allow / deny` access to resources in the AWS account.

- follow the principle of least privilege

- `the scope` of the service configurations `is global`.
  - The settings are not defined at an AWS Region level.  
  - settings apply across all AWS Regions.

- When there is a conflict, the most restrictive policy applies.
  - `allow vs deny: deny win`.

- Resources are defined using the `ARN format`
  - the syntax for ARNs
  - `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:`


2 types of policy:
- **Identity-based policies**
- **Resource-based policies**
- **Service control policies (SCPs)**


### **Identity-based policies**
- A policy that is attached to an identity in IAM
  - less overhead to use a SCP for the entire AWS account.
  - permissions policies that attach to a principal/identity (user/role/group).
- `control what actions that identity can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions`.
- Identity-based policies categorized:
  - **Managed policies**
    - prebuild, Standalone identity-based policies
    - can attach to multiple users/groups/roles in AWS account
    - A Managed Policy `applies policies` to a user, group, or role (without exceptions).
      - **customer managed policy**:
        - more flexible but requires administration.
      - **AWS managed policy**
        - has overhead, more rigid out of the two.
        - AWS managed policies have automatic updates.
  - **Inline policies**
    - Policies embedded directly to a single user/group/role
    - Inline Policies are used to create exceptions to a user, group, or role.


### **Resource-based policies**
- `JSON policy documents that attach to a resource (S3 bucket...)`.
- `control what actions a specified principal can perform on that resource, and under what conditions`.
- **inline only**:
  - define the policy on the resource itself, instead of creating a separate policy document that you attach.
  - For example
    - create an S3 bucket policy (a type of resource-based policy) on an S3 bucket
    - -> the bucket
    - -> Permissions tab
    - -> Bucket Policy button
    - -> define the JSON-formatted policy document there.
- An `Amazon S3 access control list (ACL)` is another example of a resource-based policy

![HVBkIYM](https://i.imgur.com/FW1kVeh.png)

> identity-based policy.
> - An policy that grants access to the S3 bucket is attached to the MaryMajor user.

> resource-based policy.
> - The S3 bucket policy for the `photos bucket` specifies that the user MaryMajor is allowed to list and read the objects in the bucket.
> - An explicit deny statement will always take precedence over any allow statement.
> - could define a deny statement in a bucket policy to restrict access to specific  users, even if the users are granted access in a separate identity-based policy.

determines permissions
**explicit denial policy -> explicit allow policy -> deny**



### Service control policies (SCPs)
- one type of policy that can use to manage organization
  - Attaching an SCP to an AWS Organizations entity (root, OU, or account) defines a guardrail for what actions the principals can perform.
- enables permission controls
  - Service control policies can `limit account usage` to organizational units or linked accounts.
  - offer `central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in organization`, 
  - ensure accounts stay in organization’s access control guidelines.
- available only in an organization that has all features enabled, including **consolidated billing**.

- similar to IAM permissions policies
  - almost the same syntax. 
  - JSON
  - However, SCP policies `never grants permissions.`
  - `but specify the maximum permissions` for an organization or OU.

- restrict a root user of an Organization Unit account
  - Creating and attaching an SCP is a way to restrict a root user on an account.
  - defines a safeguard for the actions that accounts in the organization root or OU can do.
  - Attaching an SCP to the organization root/unit (OU) 
    - Log in to the master account and create the SCP
    - Select the `Organizational Unit`
    - `Enable the SCP` for the Organizational Unit
    - SCPs are not automatically enabled;
    - Attach the SCP to the member account within the Organizational Unit

- not a substitute for well-managed each account. 
  - still need attach IAM policies to users and roles in organization's accounts to actually grant permissions to them.

- `FullAWSAccess`
  - a service control policy 
  - allows users to access services/resources on an attached account.
  - allows access to all AWS services within an attached member account

## IAM root account


The root account has full administrative permissions and these cannot be restricted.

- Best practice for root accounts:
  - Don’t use the root user credentials.
  - Don’t share the root user credentials.
  - Create an IAM user and assign administrative permissions as required.
  - Enable MFA.

---

## IAM users

maximum amount of IAM users per account: 5,000

IAM users can be created to represent applications and these are known as “service accounts”.


Each user account has a friendly name and an ARN which uniquely identifies the user across AWS.
- A unique ID is also created which is returned only when you create the user using the API, Tools for Windows PowerShell or the AWS CLI.


You should create individual IAM accounts for users (best practice not to share accounts).	


authenticate: how the user is permitted to use to access AWS resources.
- 2 types: 
  - programmatic access 
  - AWS Management Console access.
  - only or both


- **programmatic access**:
  - `access key ID` and a `secret access key`
    - cannot be used to login to the AWS console.
    - can only be used once and must be regenerated if lost.
  - to make an `AWS API call` by `AWS CLI/SDK/other development tool`.


- **AWS Management Console access**
  - browser login window.
    - 12-digit account ID / corresponding account alias.
    - `user name and password`
  - If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled: an authentication code.
    - With MFA, users and systems must provide an `MFA token + the regular sign-in credentials`, before access AWS services and resources.
    - **for generating the MFA authentication token**:
      - `virtual MFA-compliant applications`(Google Authenticator / Authy 2-Factor Authentication...),
      - `U2F security key devices` (Yubikey)
      - `hardware MFA devices` (Gemalto)

## IAM group
Important characteristics of groups:
- A group can contain many users
- a user can belong to multiple groups.
- **Groups cannot be nested**.
  - A group can contain only users,
  - a group cannot contain other groups.
- There is `no default group` that automatically includes all users in the AWS account.
- group with all account users in it, you need to create the group and add each new user to it.
- A group is not an identity and `cannot be identified as a principal in an IAM policy`.

---

## IAM roles

![ilJwlvj](https://i.imgur.com/W0u4eW2.png)

- an identity in account that has specific permissions.
- is an AWS identity that can attach permissions policies 
- but instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is `intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.`
- an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. 

- Roles can be assumed temporarily through the console or programmatically with the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell or API.


- not using permanent credentials 
  - `does not have standard long-term credentials` (password/access keys associated with it...)
  - assume a role, the role provides `temporary security credentials` for role session.
  - Temporary credentials are primarily used with IAM roles and automatically expire.
  - IAM users or AWS services can assume a role to obtain temporary security credentials that can be used to make AWS API calls.


- IAM roles are not associated with a specific user or group. 
  - Instead, trusted entities assume roles, such as IAM users, applications, or AWS services such as EC2.
  - delegate permissions to resources for users and services
  - IAM users can temporarily assume a role to take on permissions for a specific task.


- assign limitation
  - A role can be assigned to a federated user who signs in using an external identity provider.
  - an IAM user in the same AWS account as the role or a user in a different AWS account. 
  - but cannot apply multiple roles to a single instance.


- allowed to assume IAM Roles
  - `IAM Users`
    - When an IAM User is needing elevated permissions for a temporary task
  - `External accounts`
    - grant access to your account to third parties to perform an audit on your resources.
    - When a trusted remote account needs access to AWS resources
  - `AWS services/resources`
    - When an AWS service or resource needs access to other AWS service or resource
  - `Applications`
    - allow a mobile app to use AWS resources, but do not want to embed AWS keys within the app (difficult to rotate and can potentially extract).
    - When an external application needs access to an AWS resource like `DynamoDB`
  - **IAM Groups are not allowed to assume IAM Roles**.

- use roles to `delegate 托付 access to users/app/services` that do not normally have access to your AWS resources.
  - For example
  - grant users in the AWS account access to resources don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account.
  - grant AWS access to users who already have identities that are defined outside of AWS, such as in your corporate directory.


- two types of policies in an IAM Role
  - The `trust policy` 
    - allows identities to assume roles
  - the `permission policy` 
    - defines the permissions provided.
    - A permissions policy must also be attached to the user in the trusted account.

- Wildcards (*) cannot be specified as a principal.

- For all of these example use cases, roles are an essential component to implementing the cloud deployment.


- IAM roles with EC2 instances:
  - IAM roles can be used for granting applications running on EC2 instances permissions to AWS API requests using instance profiles.
  - Only one role can be assigned to an EC2 instance at a time.
  - A role can be assigned at the EC2 instance creation time or at any time afterwards.
  - When using the AWS CLI or API instance profiles must be created manually (it’s automatic and transparent through the console).
  - Applications retrieve temporary security credentials from the instance metadata.

## AWS Organizations


- With AWS Organizations, **Consolidated Billing** is always enabled. 
  - All other features are either enabled / disabled as a group 
  - cannot individually enable or disable a feature - it's all or nothing
