- automated security assessment service
- assesses applications for `exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices`.
- check for unintended `network accessibility and vulnerabilities on EC2 instances`.

- produces a **detailed list** of the security issues

  - The name of the assessment template that was used to produce this finding
  - The assessment run start time, end time, and status
  - The name of the rules package that includes the rule that triggered this finding
  - The name of the finding
  - The severity level of severity of the finding
  - The description of the finding
  - prioritized steps for remediation
  - Select the link to learn more about Amazon Inspector findings.
  - These findings can be reviewed directly or as part of detailed assessment reports which are available via the Amazon Inspector console or API.


- Amazon Inspector includes a knowledge base with hundreds of rules
  - Use `rules packages` to evaluate an application
  - mapped to common `security compliance standards and vulnerability definitions`.
  - whether remote root login is enabled
  - whether vulnerable software versions are installed.
  - These rules are regularly updated by AWS security researchers


- analyze the behavior of the resources and helps `identify potential security issues`.
  - Analyzes the VPC environment for potential security issues.
  - identify EC2 instances for common security vulnerabilities.
  - asses EC2s for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices.
  - Results come in the form of detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity

- helps improve the `security and compliance` of applications deployed on AWS.

- Inspector uses a `defined template` and assesses the environment.
  - define a collection of resources to include in the assessment target and create an `assessment template` to launch a security assessment run of that target.
  - `analyze EC2 instances against pre-defined security templates` to check for vulnerabilities
  - Provides the findings and recommends steps to resolve any potential security issues found.
